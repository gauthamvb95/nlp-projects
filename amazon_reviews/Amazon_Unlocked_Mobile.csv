But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need.

I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.,19

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,5,"Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan. I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. The phone functions are great. The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly.",1

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,4,"First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.",12

It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.",17

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,2,"Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste.",9

In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!",3

The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.",12

The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting.

"(LANDVO) 5.0"" Capacitive Touch MTK6582 Quad Core Android 4.2.2 3G Phone 512MB RAM 4GB ROM 2MP CAM WiFi GPS - Black",HTM,69.99,5,"Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the ""cheapest quad-core phone,"" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn't a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn't bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn't have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0"" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It's not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn't be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I've noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded. If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 4.4 already installed! You will love it if you do.",16

I really like that the numbers are huge and also the display is quite clear and crispy and simple to understand. He had no problem adjusting to this new device.It has a FM radio which does not need headphones to work it has a camera which is OK not the best but plausible. It has an SD slot for media. But it cannot play music nor the videos files they dont show up when i try search the folders in the memory. I like that it has an LED light to alert him of any notifications which is a plus and the ringtones are pretty loud too. Good pick for aging parents.,1

The cheaper Tracfone card is available, and I'll ask my daughter to take another try when she has time, but she has her own job and family to take care of.

If I need access to all those smartphone apps, I just use my laptop! Besides, the screens are tiny and I am farsighted, so that means if I use a smartphone, I am going to have to carry even more items: reading glasses.But I am an adventurous type, biking, motorcycling, hang gliding, scuba, etc. and could find myself in need of assistance during one of these risky adventures. And I do live alone and might need to get help in a car breakdown or a home injury situation. So I bought one of those pre-paid cells and thought, there you go that's problem is solved. No it wasn't. I kept pocket dialing. I couldn't see the screen either. But worse thing was the battery would go dead on me every few days. Since I never used the cell phone except for emergencies, I would always always forget to charge it. So a prepaid didn't work as my emergency phone.Jethro solved the problem. It is a big screen clamshell that is about as inexpensive as a pre-paid, but soooo much more useful. Because it is a clamshell, I get no more pocket dialing. Because it is a big screen, I don't have to carry reading glasses around. I am actually using it a little for taking TODO notes and using the calculator, as well as its great FM radio and flashlight. And its battery lasts more than a week in standby mode! Honestly, I haven't used it yet for a real emergency phone call yet (but I placed several test calls - works great) , but Jethro took my pre-paid T-Mobile SIM with no problems and I was up and running in a few minutes.So if you need a cellphone you can throw in your backpack or glove box in case of emergency, this is it.

"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,5,"With a little bit of effort I was able to familiarize myself with this phone, and using it became intuitive. It came with a nice easy to read booklet, and before purchasing it I checked to see if it has a web, site which it does. I inserted the sim card and charged the battery which took a couple of hours. I did have several problems at first, but this was my first cell phone so I didn't have much experience. I mistakenly set the language to Portuguese so I couldn't figure out what to do. Luckily there were several online tutorials at the web site and I restored the phone to the factory setting. Once in English I was able to figure the phone out more easily. One thing I figured out was to use military time as in 2pm equal 1400 when setting the time as there was no am or pm setting. All in all I am happy with the phone. Being hearing impaired I am able to hear the basic ring which is loud. When I put it in my pocket I face the keypad to my leg as the speaker comes out the back and it's even louder. Same thing when I set it on the table I put it face down and the ring is loud and clear. I questioned about using a lanyard and e-mailed the Jethro company. They got right back to me and confirmed that a small hole on the upper left side could accommodate a lanyard by removing the back, feeding the lanyard through the hole and looping it around before replacing the back. The customer service was nice and answered my question in an easy to understand manner. The phone will lock in my pocket so it wont random dial. All I need to do is press the * asterisks until the screen says the phone is unlocked, then I can dial out. The phone always accepts a call without turning it on. This is exactly the simple phone I was looking for. I returned several that did not work. I went with this model so I can use it with Consumer Cellular which is less expensive. For $14.25 (with my AARP discount) I get 4 hours of talk per month.",11

"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,59.99,4,"I bought it for my mom who is in her late 70s after her other highest rated ""senior"" phone stopped working. I hated that other phone as it was very confusing for me to operate the menu functions. So I took a chance on this one despite some of the complaints I read about in the reviews.Some of those problems have been addressed and corrected. It is no longer difficult to lock or unlock the keys. You press the lower left button down for a couple of seconds and the word locked comes up, I assume, since that's what it says in Spanish. I set my mom's phone to Spanish. There is a second way of doing it with a directional key, but we didn't need to try it since my mom got it right away. And she is definitely not good with technology.Another complaint was about the clock being set to military, or 24 hr time. Well, you can now choose to set it to 12 hr.The phone was easy to set, which was a relief for me, compared to her previous phone. Let's face it, it's the non seniors who will probably have to set it up. Sometimes in an effort to simplify phones, they take away buttons which makes them harder to navigate.The phone is very light weight. The ringer is loud enough. I like the cradle, which is easier for a senior. You can't beat the price. It worked well with the SIM card.On the negative side, I will agree with one complaint, it's not loud enough. I turned the volume all the way up and was afraid mom would not be able to hear the caller. She agreed to give it a chance, but we may have to exchange it since her hearing is not great. The back cover is thin plastic and I was afraid to break it when I removed it. I wish it had an alarm.When it comes to ""senior"" phones, it's slim pickings. This one is half the price of the old one and comes close to meeting all the requirements. Since most seniors are hard of hearing, they really need to make it louder.",20

This is extremely confusing for my mother. I bought this phone last Nov. I called Jethro sometime in Dec regarding this and was advised there was a firmware update coming out late Dec / early Jan.

So expect reception to get worse over time.* The time/date was not set automatically. Seriously? What year is this?* Unlike every other phone, the buttons directly under the screen are not actually the navigation buttons, they are M1 and M2 which are speed dials. Probably not a problem if this is someone's first phone, but it drove me nuts.* no FCC id! This phone might be illegal to use in the US.* Poor manufacturing quality - the battery is hard to insert and remove because the battery is slightly too big for the part where it's supposed to fit* The voice mail number has to be programmed. Similar to the time/date, every other phone I've ever had picked this setting up from the network automatically.* As other reviews have mentioned, the hangup button, if pressed for longer than about 1 second, the phone powers off.

To unlock the phone, you need to press the unlock key 3 times. The first press wakes up the phone, the second press results in a message which says to press the unlock key to unlock. The third press unlocks the phone. There isn't any easier method for unlocking the keyboard without disabling the lock altogether.If you are buying this phone for someone elderly with technology ""issues"" (as we did), they may have a lot of difficulty using this phone. If the three unlock presses aren't done quick enough, the unlock sequence has to be started again. If the unlock key is pressed 4 times, the phone will be locked again instead of being unlocked. All of this is very difficult to explain to someone with dexterity and technology issues.I have never heard of a phone that is this difficult to unlock. It's hard to believe that there isn't an easier method to unlock the phone. However, I have called customer support and they confirmed that the phone does take 3 unlock presses to unlock the phone. The only alternative is to disable the lock feature.On the plus side, the SOS key does work very well and doesn't require one to unlock the keys. The SOS key can be programmed to send text messages and call 911.Another thing to note is that the title for this phone indicates that there is an extra 20% off today. However, they raised the price by about 10% yesterday to $39.99. So, you aren't saving 20%. I hate when companies raise a price just so they can tell you that you are going to save ""more"".

"2.45"" UNLOCKED Rugged Micro Android Smart Phone; Dual-Sim, WiFi, and Bluetooth",Cedar Tree Technologies,66.51,3,"Got this to complete a working scale model office. The little phone actually has a pretty accurate touch screen if I can get my fat fingers to hit only one of those little tiny keys on the keyboard. Probably not bad as a phone for someone with a kid's hands.I can't say that I'm disappointed because I got yellow, and that's what I wanted. But the only color they had in stock was green and I got yellow so drop one star. Also, when I went to put the battery in I discovered THIS PHONE IS NOT RUGGED. The battery cover simply snaps on with no seals to protect against water splashes. So minus another star.All in all its not bad for a $60 smartphone that will not take up much space in the tankbag of your motorbike, or in your hiking bag. But keep it in a zip top bag. If you have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, (or can VNC into it like I did) it will be a lot easier to set up.",1

"2.45"" UNLOCKED Rugged Micro Android Smart Phone; Dual-Sim, WiFi, and Bluetooth",Cedar Tree Technologies,66.51,3,"I like the size of the phone. Whatever happened to the days when we were supposed to make things smaller? I suppose those days are gone with most people ""needing"" to watch YouTube videos in 1080p.This phone has the right size to it, but the internal memory has much to be desired. It also doesn't use the micro SD card slot to move apps over to... I know it can probably be rooted to accomodate for this, but why must it be rooted to install more than one app on here? Isn't there an easier way, like an OTA update or something? I'm not that technically savvy... but I would like to install more than one app on here. After all, this is supposed to be a smart phone.Other than those quirks, I like the phone and use it when my daily driver would be intimidated by mother nature.

3 Pack Replacement Belt Clip Holster for Otterbox Iphone 5 Defender Case - Black,OtterBox,17.95,5,"Like a number of other reviewers I break these holsters every 3 months or so. Otterbox is good with their warranty but honestly it is a pain ( I get that - there are a lot of knock-offs). Their main competitor is even worse (no names mentioned). I like the Otterbox and have used them on three phones - all had the same issue with holster breakage. So I decided to give these generic holsters a try. I am one month into using them (and have two back-ups) - so far there have been no issues and they appear to look and work as well as the Otterbox brand at a fraction of the cost. If I break all three I will buy three more - easier and faster to get than replacements from Otterbox (not to even mention their ""competitor"". If you are willing to take a chance and ""go generic"" they are a good choice. July 15, 2016 3 1/2 months later - I am still using the first one. It looks like new and works perfectly. I do not treat these gently and am really happy with them thus far.",1

Touch screen is exceedingly sensitive, so it registers being touched even if you do not touch it.5. There appears to be nobody in the world that makes a protective case that fits this phone.

I have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews....They sound mysteriously very similar in their language style and choice of words and phrases which makes me wonder if they are in fact valid. This is a perfect example of ""you get what you pay for"".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I'm going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt based on the other reviews, which I was absolutely assured were valid, honest reviews from purchasers. Kudos to Shawyn & this company !!!",24

So, I'm mourning the loss f my G2X, this is a temporary fix. It's the same size which is nice. It has almost no phone memory so an SD card isn't even an option ( you Need one). The sound if fairly good, functionality is glitchy. It's made in China and prefers to be set up with a google account. Lots of time the scrolling will snag and the screen is unresponsive to the touch. I haven't been ablebto stop the hepatic feedback on the keys when texting\ typing. It can feather and be used as a WiFi hotspot which is good. It's pretty slow loading pages and downloading, I haven't taken any pics yet. It fleshy seem to want to play videos very well but that may be my phone company's hangup. If you're looking at the screen , you need to look straight on, at any angle, you can't see the screen detail. Gettingbthe back off is a struggle too but it's doable. It's plastic, not metal.

"4 Inch Touch Screen Cell Phone Unlocked, Android Unlocked Gsm Smartphones Dual Camera Dual Sim Dual Standby No Contract (Blue)",,23.9,3,"OK, i'm unboxing this as we speak.1st thing I notice, is no fingernail indentations on the back cover. I cannot remove the back cover, so I can put my SimCard in....The instructions are Literally 1 page, with 1 picture. It shows the inside of the Phone, but it does NOT SHOW how to open the phone.There's no battery in the Box, so I sure hope it's INSIDE the phone already.OK, using a very thin piece of Steel, called a DRILL GAUGE, I was able to pry my way into the cover, without damaging it.The Battery is There, and I see the SimCard Slots. I'm removing the SimCard from my Old Phone (T-Mobile)...You MUST remove the battery, before putting the simcard in. The Sim card will not fit unlesss you do that.I've had the charger hooked up for a full minute, and the phone FINALLY flasshed something on the screen, before it blinked off again.The battery is Unbelievably drained. I doubt the manufacturer even Quality Control Tested it.I assume the Battery's charging, but there's no Indicator Light, letting me know.The battery's been charging for 5 minutes. The only way to get the screen to show me anything is to pop the battery out, wait a few seconds, and put it back in. It's at 1%.... 5 minutes of charging for 1%.... Do the math: It'll take 8 1/2 Hours to reach 100%.OK, Finally got the screen on, ""ipromobile.hk"" ... I have no idea what country ""HK"" is... next screen is in chinese, which was NOT SPECIFIED on the Product Description !It says ""Bahasa Indonesia"" with a Call Button. I select the Triangle (because I can atleast understand ""SHAPES"")....now something about wifi (i think), I click NEXT (i think), now a User Agreement in Chinese (i think), which i Null & Void if i cant read it, so I will ACCEPT if i can....After a bunch of button clicking and crap, I'm finally on the Phones Desktop-thing. Now I have to learn how to read whatever language this is, and change the damn thing to English...If only there was a Universal Symbol for ""LANGUAGE"". I mean, you know what the PHONE icon is, you know what the Voice Mail icon is, you know what the Bluetooth symbol... but what is it for LANGUAGE!?!?Seriously, the Language looks like a Cross between Japanese and Chinese... I cant even BEGIN to understand it....BOO YAH ! I got It ! It's in Chinese. I used Google Translate, to find the Characters for ""Language"":语言 --- Look for these 2 characters, in your phones settings, and Presto, you can select English. It's in a menu that looks like the Letter ""A""I'm activating Data Connection, so my SimCard connects to The Network, adding my Google Account, verifying my account, YAY, I'm able to make phone calls.... That's all i need this little sucker to dao anyway....the internal phone storage says ""178mb""...You Know, for being a cheap, $40 Piece of Crap, this thing seems to work better than my $600 LG G3. It may not have the CAPABILITIES of the more expensive phone, but this is still a pretty good little phone. Definately a good back-up phone, for when my High-dollar one breaks.",18

The main problem with this product is that the only documentation provided is a folded up small piece of paper that is written by someone who does not speak english. So there is no adequate user manual, and it becomes a magical mystery search trying to figure out how to use the phone.2. A second serious hardware problem is that the speaker runs extremely hot, and one cannot place it next to the ear. Must use earphones, or suffer burns.3. Battery life totally sucks.4. Touch screen is exceedingly sensitive, so it registers being touched even if you do not touch it.5. There appears to be nobody in the world that makes a protective case that fits this phone. It would have been smart to make its form factor mathc an iPhone5 or 6, or Samsung, or SOMETHING.6. Other than the above, the phone is OK, and well worth the price.",2

There were 12 five star reviews when I bought the phone. The phone is absolutely terrible. The security sticker was broken when I got my product, and when I contacted the seller they said that was okay as long as the phone worked. I still haven't been able to use data on the phone and can only use for calls and texts. Also, I'm afraid to out this phone up to my ear. When I did, it burned really hot and radiated heat. It is cheaply made. The touch screen is fickle and unresponsive. It has zero in phone storage, so no apps. Bottom line is that I wished I would have spent a little more money and bought a different phone.",6

This phone is still loading....To restate other reviews: terrible viewing angle, despite adjustments to sensitivity of screen finally on the 55th tap, the screen responded to request....it seems to be hit or miss.....and this phone is just not up to USA phone standards....I'll probably be returning it altho it is a great looking phone !Other than making or receiving calls, this would just pretty much be a paper weight. I have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews....They sound mysteriously very similar in their language style and choice of words and phrases which makes me wonder if they are in fact valid. This is a perfect example of ""you get what you pay for"".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I'm going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt based on the other reviews, which I was absolutely assured were valid, honest reviews from purchasers. Kudos to Shawyn & this company !!!",24

I was given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5"" Android phone and passed it along to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look ""uncool"" and the screen is BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way.",4

The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",1

I was given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5"" Android phone and passed it along to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look ""uncool"" and the screen is BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way.",4

"5.5"" Android Cellphone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Smartphone White",JUNING,161.06,5," I am so impressed with this T5 model unlocked phone from JUNING. Impressive, why? Getting an android phone for $77.99 is awesome, with all the great features that other expensive phone have and it works great with our wifi connections and also works great while using my GSM sim card. Works smoothly and fast because of the processor unit that is quad core which is the fastest CPU that can be found on expensive smartphones and has an android 5.1 that provides a performance and stability updates, multiple SIM card support, HD voice calling and ""Device Protection,"" which secures lost or stolen devices against factory resets. It has a dual unlocked sim, which is great for a person like me, I have a small business and my business phone number is always separated to my personal number, mostly I will not talk to customers on weekends so that I can spare time with my family. Another thing is, because it’s unlocked, it can be use or compatible to all gsm networks and works great while traveling to different places.Talking about the camera, I am surprisingly amazed even though it’s only has 2.0 MP both front and back but it’s really clear, it seems that it has a 5.0 MP same as my camera before with 5.0 MP. Watching a video and listening to music to it, are totally responsive without any hang ups experience, the audio is totally clear and loud. Last but not the least that I love the most, is the wide touch screen that I didn’t have before, the screen is wide and crisp with a decent resolution and most of all it is slim, thin and lightweight and a slick product, so fast to response with only a soft touch. It is really impressive and very affordable to everyone. I’ve been using this as my regular phone for a couple of days now and I really love the way it works and the appearance on this phone is very classy and so handy. As you can see on the images below the back cover has rough surface with a good grip to prevent you from dropping it. The package includes: T5 model phone, Battery, USB Cable, Power adapter and earphone. This phone has 4 color options to choose from, Black, gold, pink and white. Indeed, Impressive worth to keep and handle with care. Highly recommended to everyone who's searching a affordable phone that works great. Thank you JUNING for this awesome product. I got this for free/discounted price through a promotional period and this is one of those deals where I am so blessed to get and test the efficiency and assess it for their future buyers. This will make it easier for others to find this review so they may be helped as well. I don’t get anything from it, but I get a good feeling that I helped someone.

Just make sure to buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card.One of my favorite features of this phone is the smartwake feature. You just have to tap the screen and it will turn the screen on. I also like the fact that the screen size is big enough to see pictures and videos clearly or read texts without difficulty.There are many emerging new smartphones in the market nowadays but Juning smartphones are highly competitive in terms of size, features and especially price.So if you are looking for a trustworthy brand, look at Juning smartphones' direction sold by Qianhai Changying. They have plenty of models to choose from. And this particular model, the Juning T5 has a very good value for the money. It's yours for only $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review.",1
"5.5"" Android Cellphone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Smartphone White",JUNING,161.06,5," I am so happy that I got this phone because it carries a lot of cool phone features that i really like. It has 5.5 inches display size which i think is a perfect phone size...It is a half inch bigger than my other phone but yet the weight is just the same and i find it quit good because i still can carry it where ever i go and with the bigger screen size i can totally see every thing clear...I like that it is unlocked and has dual sim card and a memory card slots you can use a regular sim size and a micro sim card i find it very nice because if you go to other country you can just bring this phone and use it right away you just need to get a GSM sim card if your here in the US GSM sim card includes t-mobile, AT&T, cricket, straight talk and sprint how cool is that...This phone's support network's 2G and 3G it does not support 4G which is alright with me...This phone has four available color to choose from there is black, gold, pink and white for you to have. It is up to you what color do you like to get. Plus this phone has a built in wifi, blue tooth, tethering and portable hot spots so no need for us to worry on how to connect to the internet if we are on the go..I was amazed with this phone it does exceeds my expectation especially when i tried using the camera it really amazes me how clear and how nice the pictures are plus the volume of this phone is very good I cannot ask for more I am very happy and so glad that i ordered and got this phone for myself...For under a hundred dollar price this phone is a very good bargain for you guys..So far so good, for now i do not have any complains about this product I will totally recommend this product to my friends and family because this phone is real nice...I received this product for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.

"5.5"" Cell Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Smartphone White",JUNING,99.99,4," This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products.

I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package.

"5.5"" Cell Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Smartphone White",JUNING,99.99,5," Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.",1

"5.5"" Cell Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Smartphone White",JUNING,99.99,5," This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.",10
"5.5"" Cell Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Smartphone White",JUNING,99.99,5,"Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone.

It already have pre-installed Facebook, whatsapp, and gmail but you can install also other app that you love. The storage can hold up to 8GB enough space for you to save pictures, videos and games etc.Unfortunately this cellphone is only 3G but you can still use internet, on your phone by your SIM card or wifi works as good as 4G phones. I use sprint SIM card because it is the only phone company works at my area since l live out of town. But you can also use this phone with any other prepaid sim card.All in all this is a decent phone and it works good, affordable and user friendly. Though you can't compare this phone to a high end phone because you can still spot a difference. For the price this is a decent phone.

"5.5"" Cell Phones Unlocked 3G/GSM Dual Sim Android 5.1 Quad Core-JUNING Smartphone White",JUNING,99.99,5," The JUNING phone I got was a 5.5"" Dual Sim Phone Unlocked 3G/GSM Android 5.1 Quad Core. Color : GOLDThe functionality of the phone is very similar to any Android phones but this one is very affordable and unlocked.The phone comes with:*Charger (USB-port)*Earphones*User's Manual*Clear phone case*A piece of paper with the note in order to use the battery.(remove the yellow film)*Attached to the screen already,the screen protection/scratch protection (a thin sheet)Like any other phones you got to test the functionality of it and I find it very easy to navigate. It has the default apps that we commonly use, like Facebook, Wechat, Whatsapp, ect. I added Facebook Messenger, Youtube, Google chrome web browser and even added NETFLIX.Camera, which we mostly use to capture the moments and share it to our family and friends. I have no complain, it captures very clearly.Battery wise, I fully charged it the first time and I watched one full movie for like 2 hours and it has still a little half of the battery. I was able to explore some of the features, check emails and do some social networking.But you got to read the label or the note that comes with it because there is a little film that you need to remove in order for you to use the battery.Size and weight: I think it is the perfect size of the screen for me and not heavy at all to carry around. The GOLD color is a plus, it looks so sophisticated and sleek.If you wanna do some screenshots, just press the button volume down and power button together. Because it is 3G you do not expect it to be as fast and quick as 4G.I connected it to my Wi-Fi and and connects pretty well.Over all impression: For this price of an Unlocked android phone is pretty good. If you go overseas and you need a phone that is unlocked and you can just plug in a prepaid sim card, this is a perfect solution and highly recommend this. You don't have to carry your phone that will charge you enormously when you use it overseas.I tried my T-Mobile sim and it works well.Got this phone in a discounted price for an honest review based on my experience while using it. And to help others who are looking for affordable and unlocked phones that works like any android phones that are expensive.",2

"5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue",JUNING,99.99,5," This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.",10
"5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue",JUNING,99.99,5,"Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!",4

"5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue",JUNING,99.99,4," This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review.",2

Once I received it, I immediately began to charge it and was able to start the phone successfully. The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth. I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package. This cell phone is very easy to use. I especially like having a dual sim option so that I can have a my work phone number be separate from personal number. This phone is very affordable and looks great!I love this cell phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.I received this cell phone at a reduced or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",0
"5.5"" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue",JUNING,99.99,5," Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.",1

I had to re-learn how to make and receive calls, since this is the first time I have used a smart phone. I have an android tablet that I enjoy so I find this android smartphone to be handy to take with me if I want to browse on WiFi when I am away from home. I used to take the tablet and the cellphone with me when I went out. Now they are combined in one unit. This android cellphone/tablet is slow for a quad-core OS.

"5.5"" Unlocked GSM Smartphones Android 5.1 MTK6580 Quad Core Dual Sim Quadband-JUNING 3G Cellphone White",JUNING,99.99,5," Android Lollipop on a budget. This phone is great. It keeps the pre-installed apps at a minimum but gives you what you need at the same time. I won't list all of the specs of the phone here as you can see them on the product page. But I will tell you that this is a nice looking phone, it has smooth features and doesn't feel cheap. The camera is awesome, front and rear facing cameras too. The screen on this is clear and responsive to touch. I have owned many phones and this has the functionality of the higher end phones without the price tag. This is actually less expensive than most deductibles on phone insurance policies and then they give you a refurbished phone anyway. Checkout the pictures and video for more details on the user experience.

"5.5"" Unlocked Smartphone Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Black",JUNING,99.99,4," This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review.

I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!",4

The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price.",0

This is the so called 发哥版, you would need to know a bit of Chinese and find the right CWM image for it.The resolution is of course on the low side for such a big phone. On the other hand, I purchased it for my mother and configured it with huge fonts in any case, so it didn't bother me.",0

It is unlocked but It was not rooted. It is subject to annoying ""GSM Buzz"" near my radio/TV/speakers. I like the dual SIM slots. I use one plan for voice and another for data/text. Or you can use each SIM for different countries services when travelling. The manual and warranty is in Chinese, but it's easy to figure out. It's a phone: Insert battery, Insert SIM, insert micro SD, insert charger cable, charge, tap on Settings. That's pretty much what a quick-start guide will say.The ear buds are cheap. So buy your own ear buds.",0

I did not find Google play when it arrived.you have to figure out how to change the default Chinese browser into a English one. Some things are still in Chinese although the language was initially set to be English. this seller have not done the right rooting as it described. But that does not prevent me enjoy the phone until now. Its default setting needs to be customized if you use gophone plan. You MUST turn off the data connection service to avoid automatic connecting and charging for the online time (Could be too late when you notice that).I will add more when I learn using other functions.Just find that when you insert 32G SD card, the machine response very slow.

After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use. I got this one from PriceAngels. Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay. The seller was very prompt in getting back to me. For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level. The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones. Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1. The FM radio is very clear. You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me. I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4. The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company. This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me. This is a great phone and the price is great.",18

I was coming from a galaxy s3. Out of the box I liked the look and feel of it. Turned it on and didn't mind the little bit of Chinese or Japanese writing that still lingerd. Put my sim card in and it powered up fine. Problems started when texting. After about 30texts it stopped displaying new texts. I would get notifications saying I had one but when I went to contact to view it wouldn't allow me to scroll to see them. Then the phone would be on silent mode even if I had selected other wise so I couldn't hear when I received texts. Turned the volume up full and it still didn't work. Next was the internet. Wi-Fi connection was fine when at home or work when it had a network to connect to but not while using AT&T network (my carrier). Tried everything and got somewhat close. Sometimes it would work briefly. After loading for a few minutes a page might display but if you tried to click on a link or the next page it would say no network connection. So no internet on the go or GPS.Also if you were sent a link in a text from a friend or colleague the phone said it didn't have the correct program to continue and wouldn't connect. All in all the phone was just SO GLITCHEY! Every day something new would pop up. Even if the internet worked I just didn't feel safe having this phone as my source of contact to the world, like it would crash at any moment. My s3 just blew this phone away. Even if everything worked right it still didn't stack up. The big screen was nice but not as clear as my S3, and it was so freaking slow loading movies and pictures and web pages.I recommend avoiding this phone and looking into something else. Pay more and get something more reliable.",2

Feels like 10K, looks like 10K, fast and clean. Benefits are there are MANY MANY roms to flash very easily. The phone feels like something you would want to own!The second - I RETURNED IT :-( . First is that you MUST check the ROM kernel. If it does not say ""ROW"" in the file name you will have a headache. Just that simple. But the most important is in does NOT run on the 850MHZ in 3G/HSPDA+. I repeat it is not a 850mhz Penta Band phone in upper bands. What does this mean for you? ATT, TMobile, and MVNOs (straight talk, ect) that run on these networks will ONLY GIVE YOU 2G speeds which are to be disbanded shortly. Very few places, mostly big cities, operate that 2100mhz in USA. So if you want it for USA - sad to say - we are gonna miss out on this one.I give it 4 stars for the fact that its a 10 star phone - but CANNOT be run in ""todays"" markets in the USA.Good luck all.NOTE: Purchased twice - 1st was AXOING = NO ROW, Chinese only!; 2nd - was APlusElek = Old Rom but WAS ""ROW"" so easy enough to work with for Google services. BUT NO USA",41

5.5-Inch Unlocked Lenovo A850 3G Smartphone-(960x540) Quad Core 4GB MT6582m 1331MHz Android 4.2 Dual Camera +Dual SIM -Black (Rooted + Google Play),,161.06,5,"This is my second time buying a cellphone from amazon. As always, i did a heavy research BEFORE buying the phone and placing my order.My first impression of the phone was: Holy crap this is beautiful. Its thin, its slick and it is black and shiny all over the place! It is really something to admire.The first thing is: This phone is HUGE. Its totally a thing. And it wont stop being a thing. I mean it is a 5.5 inch screen, which makes this phone almost a tablet, which it is! so it is called a Phablet. The screen is very bright, crisp, and seriously, IPS? in my opinion the best choice for color and brightness,plus it saves battery. People complains that this phone doesn't have a 1080p screen, but really, if you can see the difference between the pixel density of this phone (aprox 200ppi ) and the pixel density of the iPhone (500 ppi) then your eyes must be better than the Kepler telescope. Go work at NASA or some stuff hehehehe. The screen size alone makes up for some things it is missing, and it totally should have, like a magnetometer. But don't get me wrong. This lil fella here is a powerhouse. It will make some phat rhymes and some ill beats for you if you play it rightThe feel of the phone is sturdy. It wont broke easily (nor i recommend you to try and break it. I mean come on) The back case has a good grip. Still i recommend you to get a phone cover, just in case. TPU will do or something more sturdier. I got one from http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EY7SS72/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1It has a LCD screen cover plus the case!!Inside the box, i got the phone (Durrrrr), Charger, Battery, A screen cover !!, a 4 GB micro SD!! , USB Cable, Wall Adapter And some cool earphones. Really complete set in my opinion. It has the bare minimum to go strolling.The charger is of good quality, sturdy, as is the USB cable and the wall adapter.About the Battery. It is a 2250 mAh battery. Now in the last two weeks i only charged the phone once every 2 days. So that gives you an approximate of 2 days of battery with GPS , WIFI and DATA NETWORK on. But that's me, I don't play much with the phone, and my heavy using apps are social ones. There is an application on the phone called Lenovo Power that manages battery in a smart way so it lasts longer. I suggest to learn it and use it.OK, opening the back case is nothing short of easy. It has a little dent to the lower right side that allows you to pull the back case fast and easy.Inside you will find 2 standard sized SIM CARD slots, Micro SD slot up to 32 GB , Phone Camera, Audio Speakers And battery slot. The phone accepts mini SIM CARDS too. Now about the DUAL SIM you must know that the First one(The one on the left) Is able to Use 3G capabilities while the other one cannot. Don't Sweat it, this is standard practice. The second SIM CARD slot will be and shall be used for a second phone line used only for calls. The audio Speaker is of good Quality. And LOUD. Good lord that thing is noisy hehehe.This phone Id is LENOVO A850. Its not a lenovo A820 and it is totally NOT a SAMSUNG GALAXY 2,3 OR 4. Nevertheless it has a bunch of qualities that will prove quite useful.Why do i mention that you ask? It is because of the camera. I kid you not. Its a 5 MP camera. Its a really good camera, but some People might want this phone to shoot pictures at a quality that is beyond the hardware. The pictures are excellent in my opinion and they will work with whats-app and other apps. It has a lot of modes like continuous shooting and auto-focus and you can set up camera quality up to 5 MP. You can record video at high quality too. It seems 1080p But in fact it is scaled from a lesser resolution. Not a problem for me tho. As always, this is a phone, not a camera.This phone has a MT6582M mediatek CPU. It is a Quad-core@1.3 GHz with a GPU MALI-400MP2. What does this Means for you? Its Fast. Trust Me , really fast. Your multimedia will play with no problems and your games will go like silk. Games like NOVA 3 and Anomaly Korea . Cool.It has 4 GB of internal memory that translates in a total of 2.31 GB in real usable space. It has too 1 GB of ram. This will Make the phone faster too, because you will be multitasking a lot with this Phone .Now going to the front side of the phone, you will find in the top The brand of the phone (LENOVO) in shiny silver letters, your 3.5 Audio Plug, power Button ,speaker, frontal camera , proximity sensor and a notification led . The frontal camera is a 1.2 MP one, it wont transmit lots of data to Skype and other apps so its ideal to make video calls. The top speaker Works like a charm as well as the proximity sensor and the 4 colors notification LED (Blue,Red,Orange,Green). I guess the LED is fully Configurable But haven't tried it yet .I will Update As Possible.In the Bottom you will find 3 silver shiny soft touch buttons, micro USB slot and microphone.The soft Buttons are from left to right:Menu Button, Home Button and Go back Button. They are shiny and silver and they wont have BACK-LIGHT. They will be visible enough in the darkness so that's it.The right side of the phone has the +/- volume buttons. The left side has nothing.OK that's with the Physical stuff. Now we go to Software.First Thing First. This Phone posses a high grade of heavy customization. And as such, it is necessary that if you are going to make use it, you are able to at least, follow instructions precisely and know your way around android OS or a computer. Sorry but that's it if you want to customize it. If not, Then don't worry ! Most Sellers are very kind and they will get you (if you ask them of course) the phone in your language be it Spanish or English or whatevs and they will customize it for you. But seriously, ask them. Don{t expect them to do it just for giggles. And certainly, do not ask after getting the phone or placing the order. Before is OK.The software is a tricky thing. My phone came with a Android 4.2.2 Rom that is called S128 Xiaomijie. It was a Chinese ROM but it came in English. I just wiped it and installed another one called S121, made by Linerty. Its more stable for me. Ill post the links At the end for you all that want to customize the phone.There is a silver lining to this. There is an announce from mediatek that this phone will get android 4.4 KITKAT at the end of this month (18/04/2014 as today) so if you go trough with the ROM change you will get the experience needed to update to KITKAT later. All this will be done manually. Bollocks.Anyways, android 4.2 goes really fast in this phone. Man, so FAST. you will get lot of apps that will make your experience with this phone something worth sharing. Your live wallpapers will be smooth, your wireless will be fast and your calls will always go trough. The android integration is really cool and it will save you lots of trouble when you set up your APN's , because at the time you insert your sim card it will get all the info you need for it.The GPS is really exact. you will get accurate measures up to +/- 2 meters. You wont need a internet connection for it to work. Only when you download your maps but apart from that, no.This phone Works Excellently in Venezuela. It works with Movilnet and Movistar (SIM CARD 1) and with Digitel (SIM CARD 2) . That{s for GSM calls. For 3G and data connection its only the SIM CARD 1.Over all, this phone is a great Purchase. I give it 10/10 points because the sheer awesomeness . Have in mind that this is a mid-end phone.And it kicks some rump.About The Seller. It was LightInTheBox. They sent Directly from China Via DHL. It was a Fast shipment (For me). I communicated with themand they were always attentive and fast at answering. Id go with them again in any case.At The time i bought the Phone it was worth 169$ . I guess it will get cheaper so get it if you can :DOne thing You must remember, This is no Samsung S5/S4 Phone, nor an Iphone, Not a tablet.

Everyone said it would. It required a sim adapter.So now on to my review.Anyone who gives this phone 5 stars has never owned a premium smartphone. For this review I am comparing to my Samsung Galaxy S5Touchscreen: With the factory provided screen protector on, sometimes its unresponsive, sometimes it freezes. I have to hold down on a touch screen button most of the time for the phone to realize its being touched and then less than half the time the button will respond. Take the screen protector off and it works marvelously, but then you risk damaging the screen.Network: Movistar DigiMobil (pay as you go plan) When I got my SIM I bought a Samsung Galaxy Young 2 to use it in. No major issues aside from phone size. In the young 2 my whatsapp worked fine and I could send texts and make phone calls in my whatsapp on only my mobile network no Wifi. Now that my SIM is in the Lenovo, it will not allow me to transmit in whatsapp at all unless connected to wifi.-In addition, there is no Internet or google play access without wifi.This is a s*** phone and is being returned",1

As it is usual in all Android phones, it came with many applications that cannot be uninstalled, but I disabled all those that I do not use and they disappear with icon and all. Screen is big and very nice, but the phone still fits in a shirt pocket, even with a case ( that I also bought at Amazon). I used a SIM in Miami and I have another one in Costa Rica, where I travel frequently and both worked fine the first time.The phone came without any setup manual and some newbies may have to download one from the Internet.",4

I've only had iPhones up till now but my 4S is starting to show it's age so instead of spending well over $700 for the iPhone 5C I decided to try out Android because I have a Nexus 7 and like it.This Lenovo A850 had the specs I was looking for and the feedback that convinced me to try it out especially since it only cost a little under $160 on Amazon including shipping.Yeah I had to wait for it to be delivered from China but it didn't take all that long. It did have it's caveats like only 4GB memory storage and 2 of that was a MicroSD card, but after swapping it for a 32GB card and flashing it with a cleaner version of Lenovo's iteration of Android 4.2.2, I'm really enjoying the power and responsiveness of this Mediatek processor. The 1GB of RAM seems ample for my general use but I've watched videos of decent gameing handled by it as well. I also like the battery life but that didn't stop me from buying an extra battery and battery charger since I can just swap out batteries making it never really needing to sit and charge unless I want to.Bottom line is if you know your way around Android even if your just a novice like me, you're gonna really like this phone! Just keep your expectations equal to the price you're paying.",7

The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price.",0

It is unlocked but It was not rooted. It is subject to annoying ""GSM Buzz"" near my radio/TV/speakers. I like the dual SIM slots. I use one plan for voice and another for data/text. Or you can use each SIM for different countries services when travelling. The manual and warranty is in Chinese, but it's easy to figure out. It's a phone: Insert battery, Insert SIM, insert micro SD, insert charger cable, charge, tap on Settings. That's pretty much what a quick-start guide will say.The ear buds are cheap.

After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use. I got this one from PriceAngels. Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay. The seller was very prompt in getting back to me. For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level. The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones. Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1. The FM radio is very clear. You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me. I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4. The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company. This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me. This is a great phone and the price is great.",18

5530 XpressMusic Cell Phone w/ Games,NOKIA,123,5,I LOVE THIS PHONE. IT'S REALLY WORTH IT. AMAZON IS VERY EFFICIENT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORKS PLEASE DON'T CHANGE.,0
5530 XpressMusic Cell Phone w/ Games,NOKIA,123,2,"Bought this phone as a factory-refurb. When it arrived, I plugged it in to charge and the splash screen came up... great I thought and walked away. Looked an hr later to check the progress and nothing had changed! No status bar, nothing! This should have been my first indication of trouble. Unplugged, plugged, unplugged, plugged and then the status bar came up...A cool feature is that the phone gives an audible alert when the battery is full! But then it was a witch to get it to turn on! Hold the button, wait for splash screen, wait to see if it initializes... if/when it doesn't, take the back off, take the battery out and start all over... usually 4-5 times before the phone would initialize! At first, I just figured this was a consequence of the battery being completely dead but nope... had to go through this EVERY time the phone was turned off!So I returned it (under the 30 day warranty) and the seller sent a new phone. Great! Well, I couldn't get the new phone past the splash screen no matter what I did!!!So, as far as features once I did get the first phone to work...The music player is really pretty nice! The built-in speakers sound great for a phone! The touch screen is responsive and the phone feels great in your hand! And, the wifi was pretty cool... BUT (and now the bad)... you can't see anything on the screen in direct sunlight! the headphone jack is proprietary. And, there aren't a lot of apps... I mean, even the facebook ""app"" was essentially a bookmark to the FB webpage. For this price point, I wasn't expecting an iPhone but seriously, this phone left a lot to be desired!So, my opinion is that this phone is a POS... 1/2 star for the phone working nicely when it worked, 1/2 star for the features, and 1 star for the music player sounding so great... Don't bother...",1

I fully recommend it; the only problem was the bad quality of the camera but fixed that with an app and its great. Does work with straighttalk bring your own phone (BYOP) packet. You have to use the att or t-mobile sim cards and you HAVE to call the customer service operators so they can do it. They will tell you its not going to work blah blah blah but it does work I ordered two of this phones and they are working perfectly wih 4G. Only bought one BYOP packet--it comes with three different sim cards so it worked for me so I could activate both phones with one packet. After you activate the service then straight talk sends you a txt so you visit a website link and activate your internet: dont worry its very easy to do.When you first get it remember to remove back cover and remove paper from battery so it wont blink when you are charging it. Its blinking cuz there's something preventing the phone from charging and the phone is telling you that.Read your instructions peopleGood luck with your phone!Thank you.,57

I usually leave my review after many weeks of using the phone so this post is late.Love the unlocked dual simcard.Pictures quality is decent and clear.cellphone features are great.High resolution.You can use this phone anywhere in the country and you can use this phone outside the country too because it's unlocked.This phone is affordable and it feels like similar to my samsung.The only down side of this phone is that I noticed if you don't use it much the battery won't stay full even you don't use it.But over all this is a great phone for the price and it won't hurt you to buy this and try.Disclamer:I got this phone for free in return to my unbiased review.",1
"6.0"" Android 5.1 Phones Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core GSM Quadband HD Display JUNING Smartphones Black",JUNING,99.99,5,"I have to start out by saying that I really like this phone. I love the 6"" screen. Once you use a 6"" screen, it's really hard to go back smaller. I currently had a 6"" when I received this phone however mine was lacking one feature that I need to have available. That's the hotspot tethering feature. In my line of work, I often end up in places that have no wifi. Which tends to make things difficult for me since I have to be on a computer often. This tethering feature allows me to put my computer on the internet when wifi isn't available as long as I have at least one bar of signal. I have tested out and love this feature as much if not more than the screen size. It's really easy to turn on and off as well.The phone has all my needs that I have to use daily already preset in it. Not only that, but the phone is capable of taking screenshots. There are still many phones that don't offer that option. This feature i use at least 50 times a day.I often listen to music and love that YouTube is readily available. On the home screen if the phone, it comes with a built in radio app. The radio app isn't the greatest but how can you complain, after all you have a radio available everyday all day long. The phone also has the Google play store preinstalled which allows you to add other music apps such as Pandora.The Google play store allows you to download games, videos, and all sorts of apps. Many if them are free of charge.I travel a lot in the evening hours and find myself using flashlights often. However, you ever tried opening a door while holding your keys, phone, and flashlight? Ya, it's hard. This phone is preloaded with the torch app which is a flashlight.Pictures is another feature i have to use daily for work, but I also take lots of pictures in my personal life. This has both front and rear facing cameras. The rear has a flash. The phone comes preloaded with a cool app that has special features for editing photos. Including the smart shot and beauty app.Can't forget to mention the clock, calendar, and calculater apps. I often have to rely on my phone as an alarm clock on the road. I have to use a calendar daily to remember all my appointments. The calculator app is also high important as I am constantly dealing with money.This phone comes with dual sim card slots. I love the idea that it can be used anywhere in the world. It's also a unlocked phone so you can put it on almost any carrier. I use a prepaid carrier. Another bonus is that you can put a micro SD card in there to expand the memory.Overall, this phone is a great phone. It actually has suited all the needs I have on a daily basis. The picture and sound quality is good. You can pick up wifi range further than a lot of phones I've had in the past. It comes ready to be used. It's packed securely and the package is discreet. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.",4

"6.0"" Android 5.1 Phones Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core GSM Quadband HD Display JUNING Smartphones Black",JUNING,99.99,5,"'JUNING SMARTPHONE C5Color: GoldSize: 6.0""I been wanting to have a new smartphone that has a bigger screen size compared to what I have right now, so I feel lucky to have this one. It comes with Manual, battery charger/USB, earphone, clear casing that fit so right and not bulky at all. Juning Unlocked Smartphone 6.0 C5 exceeded my expectations, the phone is well made and looks expensive, and so since I love to take selfie's I immediately tried the 'camera front and back, I am impressed! I had low expectations having 2.2 MP camera front and back, I thought the camera quality resolution will be bad and I'll say I am very wrong. The picture quality is decent clear, it takes a good selfies' and 'videos, I super love it, now I can take selfies anywhere I go. There's a plus for me using camera selfie of this phone, because I don't have to download picture editor or camera360 etc., it comes with it! already ready to use, just simple take your selfie, click makeup in the bottom right side of the screen then holla, there yah go, you can now beautify yourself without downloading any apps, that just saved memory storage.''''''What I like also is for 6"" smartphone it is very light to carry around, with that said I can now leave my iPad at home and just carry my Juning Smartphone C5 6"" with me, because of the size it is like having 2in1, phone and tablet at the same time which is cool. If you have small hand like me' you need to use to hands while using it. ^____^Juning Smartphone 6.0"" is unlocked phone so you can use GSM/WCDMA SIM card, it is not compatible for CDMA SIM card so be aware of that before you buy SIM card, it is good for roaming sim card number, I can now use sim card to text and call my family back home in PH.The phone is nice and clear, looks like HD. Phone storage is 4 GB, up to 16 GB, so I slot my memory card for more storage memory. I was thinking buying bigger memory card like 16GB so that I don't have to worry of getting low of memory specially storing my pictures and apps. 'The phone sound is clear, makes me enjoy listening music' '''. In regard of Battery Life, Probably won't last too long if you use it constantly with full brightness, as I experienced the phone was full since 7am in the morning,I go to work using phone, got home 5:30pm and still have battery life, that is without using it too much. It don't really bother me since I have one power bank with me all the time in case I need it. And if you want to stretch the battery life longer, you can always lower down the brightness of the display. I must say if you use too much phone, you may consider buying extra battery or power bank to be with you, Juning also have Power bank portable external battery charger with smart charger technology for affordable price, check that out.'I am using my phone often using Facebook, Instagram, listening music, watching videos and of course taking selfies/pictures, sometimes the app crashed which is natural for me, same to my old phone and even my iPad crashed too, so that's not a problem. Also, sometimes it seems phone freezing or slow down, but not a problem for me anymore, just search Mr. Google what to do, how to make android phone faster and boom problem solved. :) I don't play games right now because I don't have time for that at this moment so I can't rate that part using this phone. Connecting to wifi was fast and easy, downloading some apps with no problem.Overall for the price under $100 with 6"" screen, I can't complain! It's not the best phone out there compared to branded expensive smartphone that will cost you $$$$, and with that said without breaking your bank and still have nice 6"" smartphone.' Juning Unlocked smartphone 6.0"" C5 is perfectly right for me, I already felt like I am having a iPhone 6s.Also, Juning has a great customer service. Thank you Ms Sophie you're one of a kind.Purchased this phone for free except for the shipping and handling, this phone was like for testing in return of my honest review of this product, i am only writing what i experienced, noticed while using this phone.Pictures and video will be uploaded on my next update.'I will update once i noticed something different.",0

Finally got the sim and found out that the internet doesn't work, which means the google play store doesn't work, which means I cant do anything with this phone but call and text. This sucks because im into apps and the internet. Am I the only one who had this problem?????",5
"6.0"" FWVGA Screen MTK6577 Dual Core 1.2GHz Android 4.0 3G Smart Phone N9776 (White)",Ulefone,69.99,5,"This is an amazing Android phone. Very well-made. The price has been going up and down like a yoyo, though. Two weeks after I ordered it, there was a US$19 drop. The vendor has kindly promised to send an additional battery to make it up. Service from this vendor (lol-buy) is quite good. No complaints here.There is already a very helpful and somewhat long review thread on the orange version. I'll simply touch upon two major issues here:(1) The sim cards: I have tried an AT&T data plan micro-sim (an adapter is needed), booted up the phone and the card is recognized. After entering info in the sim management panel, 3G service is indicated by an H next to the signal bars. No problems answering and calling at all. Then a second sim from another country is tested, also recognized right away; although a field test will have to be deferred until my next overseas trip.(2) The GPS: It actually works well. A Satellite Check app (also included in the Polaris Navigation app) operating in the magnetic mode (for indoor use) picks up 9-12 satellites in a few minutes. It takes only seconds to get a fix outdoors. Google Navigation works flawlessly.On the flip side, the display is no retina display; it is just good enough for general viewing. And some apps don't work - those requiring a magnetic sensor (it does not have one), for example, the compass apps. Not deal breakers, of course.Overall, for the money, this is a surprisingly good smartphone. Some tweaking is needed, but it is part of the fun.5/13/2013 Update: (1) The vendor quickly sent over the battery. (2) After many tries, this phone simply cannot be rooted.6/4/2013 Update: This phone actually can be rooted. Now it is perfect!7/19/2013: After almost 3 months of daily use, this phone is still going strong. There has been a huge improvement, thanks to Google. The newest Google Maps no longer stays in RAM thus avoiding the previous version's eating up the memory.8/15/2013: After inserting a new battery, all of a sudden, the phone begins to randomly shut down, does not wake up from sleep, cannot fully reboot, and worse, the battery cannot be re-charged. Turns out to be a contact issue: the three copper pins on the battery and the phone sometimes do not kiss tightly. The battery needs to be about 0.1-0.2mm longer. A spacer made from aluminum foil corrects the problems. These symptoms are suspiciously similar to some previous comments complaining about a broken phone or unchargeable battery. Probably just a loose connection.3/3/2014: After testing umpteen apps. Two prove the most useful: (1) a browser with a funny name ""Naked Browser"" allows automatic deletion of history, cache, etc, on exit; and (2) MobileUncle is a must, in its Engineering -> localization mode, a GPS fix can be obtained in less than 18 sec. Others such as Documents-to-Go works well with Dropbox and phone calls, both US and international, with Viber is a breeze. This dual core phone still does a good job, it'll be interesting to see if the ones with octacore will now take over.",14

It took her a while to get use to the windows phone, in the beginning she complain a lot. And she was right because the display isn't that big, the rim is about 1 inch and if you use to work with a full display the bottom is annoying and the speaker didn't work that well (the other side couldn't hear you clearly) I think it was a glitch of windows 8.1.

Acer Liquid M220 Windows 8.1 Smartphone - Black,Acer,34.95,1,I did not receive my order items.,0
Acer Liquid M220 Windows 8.1 Smartphone - Black,Acer,34.95,1,"First off, great service as usual. I wanted a small Windows Phone and had seen this phone at the MS store. I liked the look, and thought it would work. First off, there are no directions for inserting the SIM card. Why would you need directions you ask? Because after ten minutes of dinking with it I realized that SIM1 on this phone is a ""full-size"" SIM card! Who has those anymore? So, I had to put my SIM card in the SIM2 slot. When I did that, every call I made required me to select SIM2 over SIM1. Also, it was taking way to long for all my apps to load. Ridiculously too long. But the nail in the coffin for this phone was the screen. It's awful. You have to tilt the phone just right to see the screen clearly. Just a little angle from any direction and it like your looking through one of those PC security screens from the 80's. One other reason I was interested in the phone was the textured case; I thought it would be easier to grip. Not. It's slipperier than the smooth case on my Lumina 635, which I'd use all the time if it had a front facing camera. Anyway, if any on you know of a good Windows phone with a 4"" screen I'd appreciate your feedback.",5

The Idol 4S is a great phone, it is very thin and has a beautiful build. Battery life has been great....easily 12+ hours, waaaaaay longer if you're not killing it with games all day. Stand by/idol time is amazing. Total ""screen on time"" for me is around 4-1/2 hours with checking emails, texting, you tube, reading news, music, some casual gaming (examples: SSG3, SkyForce reloaded, Words, Fieldrunners 2, Smash Hit, Defense Zone 3) for a total of 12+ hours use. It also recharges very fast. The display is AWESOME...even outside in the sun is no problem. Better than all of the above mentioned phones.

The sound is awesome on this phone whether you use headphones or not. I have not had any issues with AT&T cell signal, GPS, or bluetooth.

I have to admit I was a little leery of this phone given the fact that I am a long time Apple user. After some careful research I decided on the Alcatel IDOL 4S. It is much more affordable and still delivers the high end experience I was looking for. So far I am extremely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone to give this phone a shot. In terms of speed my IDOL 4S is noticeably faster on the web in the same environment as my Iphone 6 plus. In terms of battery I could barely get through half a day on my Iphone with heavy use. My IDOL 4S ends the day with between 30% and 40% of power left with the same kind of usage. When you do need to charge it has some technology that charges the phone super fast called “quick charge 2.0”. I take a ton of pictures with my phone and I love the fact that this phone offers a flash on the front and rear sides of the phone. The ability to expand the memory on the phone with a micro SD card is a huge plus to me because I keep so many pictures on my phone. I rarely listen to music through my phone's internal speakers, however this phone has two speakers on it! (One on the top of the phone and one on the bottom.) I compared it to my iphone and it's a huge difference. You get a surround sound affect and it is much louder than any of my other phones. I haven't tried out the VR googles yet, but the JBL headphones that come with it are surprisingly good quality. Alcatel also throws in a screen protector, making this phone a complete package. I am an AT&T customer and they have an app called ""AT&T mobile transfer"" that literally takes minutes to transfer all your contacts, videos, and pictures from your original device to your new device. So easy to use and it doesn't matter if you are going from Apple to Android based. 5 stars across the board, VERY satisfied customer!",54

When you do need to charge it has some technology that charges the phone super fast called “quick charge 2.0”. I take a ton of pictures with my phone and I love the fact that this phone offers a flash on the front and rear sides of the phone. The ability to expand the memory on the phone with a micro SD card is a huge plus to me because I keep so many pictures on my phone. I rarely listen to music through my phone's internal speakers, however this phone has two speakers on it! (One on the top of the phone and one on the bottom.) I compared it to my iphone and it's a huge difference. You get a surround sound affect and it is much louder than any of my other phones. I haven't tried out the VR googles yet, but the JBL headphones that come with it are surprisingly good quality. Alcatel also throws in a screen protector, making this phone a complete package. I am an AT&T customer and they have an app called ""AT&T mobile transfer"" that literally takes minutes to transfer all your contacts, videos, and pictures from your original device to your new device. So easy to use and it doesn't matter if you are going from Apple to Android based. 5 stars across the board, VERY satisfied customer!",54
"Alcatel One Touch Fierce 2, 4GB, 5"" Screen, Unlocked",Alcatel,118.99,2,"I bought many phones of this model for friends and for my use. All of them were working perfect at the first months. Couple of months later problems came with them. Mine one used to restart during phone conversations. Contact and other applicaions give error and I have to close them. Alarm mode does not works. If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model. The big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for T-Mobil and Metro PCS. If they are used out from USA there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. I have done root and any how the same problem with update. My last problem at the time.",0

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,4,"Review after 4 days:Pro:-Speakers are bananas-Pulling down the top bar shows a quick preview. Pull down again to show more settings.-Speakers on both sides (on top and bottom).-Battery is fantastic upon buying (great once you start downloading apps). Usually, l phones drain at an average rate and then at 20% it magically drops to 0 in no time. This drains slowly without magical drops even when I have WiFi on and using Spotify and pinterest at the same time at 4%. Good stuff.-Less bloatware: Avg antivirus, Facebook, twitter, chrome, drive, google+, hangouts, weather, WiFi transfer, adobe reader, (NFC) tags, radio, WiFi display, YouTube.-Design of app buttons - not outdated looking.-Pros say the display is meh but it looks good to me.-Double tap screen to wake up. Good if laying flat so you don't have to pick up to press power button.-Don't need to sign in password to access basic pull down settings.-If your phone dies, all the apps open when you turn on, like a computer. Nice-You can uninstall factory apps that are not run by Google. Deleted FB and Twitter, but can't delete YouTube. (Almost) for the win.Meh:-Music: songs overlap 5 secs so you know what song is next.-Camera is acceptable.-Option to pick up in any orientation. I don't need this feature but if your oober lazy/clumsy I guess this could work for you.-Power button is on left and volume is on right. Weird but okay.-Quick access to certain buttons when wake up from sleep like camera, messages, etc.Con:-UI is not intuitive like Apple/Samsung.-Lacks a lot of settings options. No universal settings button like on Samsung.-There's no main home page like on Samsung; when you press the home button, it goes to the last page you were on.-Design of buttons: instead of a backwards play button for 'go back' it is an upside down triangle. Home is a circle instead of a house. Showing all open apps is a square. As a designer, this bugs me because they have no correlation...unless they do corrolate in China.-A sealed battery.-Bottom button bar takes up far too much space and makes screen smaller.-Have to tap each text to the time stamp.-About 4 hrs after unboxing, checked music settings and pressing a song to play in library, it often skips over that song. Sometimes over 1, sometimes as much as six. O thought maybe it was the file type but if you press the backward button (next to pause, not the main), or select play next in queue and press fast forward, it will play. Annoying. Hopefully putting the songs I want into playlists will solve this, unless it skips those too.All in all, acceptable for under $200 compared to iPhone and samsung. I mean really, we are all spoiled. All you really need is call, text, and camera. Use a tablet or computer for all the app bull. Would still rather my SG-S4 because of the user interface, but I get what I need here. (My S4 just up and died on me. Won't turn on. Survived for 3 wks without it)",1
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"I know this may sound funny to many people, but this phone reminds me a lot of iPhone 6. They both have similar dimension and the same screen size. The Idol 3's build quality is very good and it just doesn't feel like a budget phone. I absolutely love the screen for its resolution and color. This came from someone who have used LG G4 and Motorola Moto X and Moto G. This phone is not the fastest out there but it is smooth enough for every day use. I didn't experience any delay so far unlike BLU Life One 4G LTE (2015) which I returned for sluggish performance. I would recommend Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 4.7"" to anyone who doesn't like all those huge 5.5"" phones out there but rather has a small easy to handle phone.",2
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,2,"Lasted less than a month.I went to sleep one night with the phone on the included USB charger. When I woke up, I noticed it was glitching very badly between my PIN lock screen and the home screen dashboard. My touches did not register. I couldn't even make it go into a hard reset.Fast forward one hour later -- it had stopped holding a charge. The phone died pretty hard and at a time I was least expecting it.Fast forward some more -- I attempt to RMA the phone. Their website isn't very intuitive when it comes to finding a repair center. Eventually I find their US repair center. I start filling out the forms, but then I realized I couldn't grab my phone's IMEI and chalked it up as a $175+ loss. Fortunately I have the budget to grab a new phone, but that's still a lot of money to spend on a phone just to have it stop working after a month of moderate use.It's a shame, because for the price, it's a snappy little phone. I liked their UI, and it was fairly close to stock Android. Way better than anything with Touchwiz shoved on it, that's for sure. The camera wasn't that great, but I was willing to live with that. I may grab another one just because I liked the UI so much, but I am going to be very weary and much more proactive about keeping the proper warranty info.Maybe it would just be worth getting a Moto G instead.",1

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"Pros-Smooth Performance-All Day Battery Life-Excellent Build Quality-Good Quality Screen-NFC (Android Pay Compatible)-Decent Camera-MicroSD ExpansionCons-Awkward Button Placement-Squeaky Vibrating Motor-Updates not guaranteed-No Gorilla GlassShould you buy: YESActual Value: $220I loved my Moto G. It made me always question why people spend over $600 on phones when a $200 could work just as well. With the new Moto G, I was willing to buy it right on the spot. But what turned me off was the nearly 3 weeks I’d have to wait for one to be delivered. So I started my search for the next best phone under $200, which lead me to this phone. I’ve had some experience with Alcatel phones, so I didn’t have much expectations with this phone. That being said, I’ve had a couple of days with it and I can say with absolute confidence that I love it.-Design-This is one light phone. I’m starting with that because you have no idea how light it is until you hold it in your hand. I actually thought for a moment that the battery wasn’t inside it yet. But it is pleasant to hold in the hand. The design is all plastic, so don’t expect anything premium on this phone like metal. But it is solidly built, rivaling even the Galaxy S5 in build quality. Speaking of which, this phone is lighter and slimmer than the S5. If the phone were sold for more money, I’d still be satisfied. It’s not just good build quality for the price. It’s excellent build quality. Period. The chrome accent is a nice touch and the speaker grills are slightly angled towards the phone, which add a bit of sparkle to an otherwise black phone. No soft touch plastic on this phone, but it does land on a middle ground where the plastic is nice to touch and is resistant to fingerprints. The design is completely symmetrical, which is important for a certain feature that is unique to it. I’d love it even more if it were available in a different color such as white, but that is personal preference. Overall, I can’t find much to complain; especially for the low $180 price.-Performance-If you have seen the Moto G’s specs, you’re pretty much getting the same hardware. It uses a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, microSD expansion, Android Lollipop, and even the same camera module (Sony IMX 214). However, there are a few key difference that make this a better phone than the Moto G. For instance, this phone has 1.5 GB of RAM (Moto G=1GB), actual front facing stereo speakers, a 4.7” compared to the 5”, NFC, and 16GB of storage(Moto G=1GB). In benchmarks, I have gotten similar results to the Moto G in both CPU and graphic performance. But benchmarks are only one side of the performance experience. The other is daily user experience. Based on the couple of days with it and after installing many apps, I can tell you that this phone is snappy. It’s not as fast as the current flagship lineup, but it never lags or clips the graphics. Apps open relatively quickly and the animations are smooth, as well as the transitions from one app to another. In my testing of multitasking ability, it opened Chrome, Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and YouTube with no lag and each app open where I left them off. Opening more will force the phone to suspend one of those apps to save RAM, but 4 apps at once without closing is pretty good for the cost. Games also perform good, as long as you have reasonable expectations. 2D games such as Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and Clash of Clans run smoothly and without an issue. Other games like Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 will run smooth, but not at the highest quality setting. But that’s to be expected from a midrange phone. Signal quality is good. I was able to get 62 Mbps download speed and 8 Mbps upload on T-Mobile’s 4G LTE around Pasadena, CA. Thanks to band 12 support, cell signal in buildings is good with the signal almost never going under 3 bars. The speakers are also amazingly good and loud, coming close to matching HTC’s Boomsound phone speakers thanks to the help from JBL. Overall, it performs close to flagship specs, albeit a bit slower. Most people should be happy with this phone.-Display-The phone itself has a beautiful HD display with a 312 PPI (note that the iPhone 6 has a 324 PPI) and it is advertise as being calibrated by Technicolor. While they aren’t at the S6’s quality display, it does come close. The display has a nice color calibration, with vivid colors and nice blacks and whites. It is also bright enough for using even in direct sunlight and the good contrast means you can clearly see what you are doing. It isn’t perfect since there are a couple of issues. The colors do have a VERY slight cool tone, meaning that the whites do have a TINY bit of blue to them. Another small issue is that there is a slight amount of light bleed on one side of the displace. But it isn’t noticeable in daily use and it is good for the price of the phone. One crucial one is the fact that they aren’t using Gorilla glass on this display, opting for the more discreet Dragontrail Glass. Since this is going to be my daily driver, I didn’t want to test the toughness (if Alcatel provides me a unit, I’d gladly test it) but I’ve looked into it and it trades scratch resistance for toughness. It might be easier to scratch it, but it is more resistant to shock. Only time will tell and I will update this review as time moves on.-Camera-The camera is a back-facing 13 MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. The rear camera uses a Sony Exmor IMX 214, which is the same unit found in the new Moto G and the more expensive Nexus 6. The results are mixed though. On one side, outdoor pictures are good. Whenever there is good lighting such as outside or a well lit room, the pictures do come out high quality with colors mostly accurate and the camera absorbing a lot of details. However, during the night, the picture quality takes a hit, with the camera struggling to get any details from the lack of light. It will get some details if they is ANY type of light, but not much. The lack of OIS also contributes to this issue, but there is no phone with OIS at this price range at the moment. The flash is okay, but since it isn’t a dual tone unit, the light tends to overflow and photos tend to lose their details. Videos are also a similar story, with good lighting providing good results and the opposite being true. There is EIS, but the effect isn’t that noticeable and it doesn’t really help with the quality. This isn’t a camera you’re going to use for important, memorable moments. But for things that most people use, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it works great. This is especially true for the front facing camera, with the selfie cam grabbing a lot of details, provided there is good amount of light.-Software-This is basically running a close to stock version of Android Lollipop. It is running version 5.0.2 with a Stagefright patch already added to protect the phone from foreign attacks. There are a few changes to the software. For instance, the icons look like similar to the iPhone, which can be both a good and bad thing, depending on whether you love or hate that style. Other than that, everything works just like stock Android. Except for one feature that I’m surprised isn’t universal to all phones. That is the fact that this phone is reversible. It doesn’t sound as exciting as fingerprint sensor, but it is a rather practical and underrated feature. I’ve answered the phone to test the sound quality and it wasn’t until after I hung up that I realized the phone was upside down. It sounds equally good on either orientation and it is brilliant. Of course, if you don’t like this (for some reason) there is always the option to turn it off. Overall, the light touch that Alcatel added onto Android hasn’t hurt it much and any problems can be easily fixed.-Conclusion-I wasn’t expecting to get a high quality phone, especially after my experience with an old model that I can’t even remember the name. But Alcatel did deliver a high quality experience and an astonishing device. It does have some compromises, but Alcatel chose them wisely and the overall result is great. There is a couple of phones that compete in this range, but the biggest one is the Moto G. Is this better? Yes and no. For power users, I would still recommend the high end Moto G because of the extra RAM or even a OnePlus One, which is on sale now for $299. But if it must be under $200, like for college students like me, this beats the $179 low end Moto G due to the higher quality speakers, display, NFC, and the slightly more RAM. This phone helps to answer the question: Do people really need to spend over $800 on a phone to get a high quality experience? The answer for most people is no. They don’t. There is a market for people who need to have the latest and greatest with all the new extras like fingerprint sensor and DSLR-like quality cameras. But for the rest of us, there are phone that does what we ask from it and reasonably well not just for the price, but just overall. If you are on the fence and frustrated from searching like I was, let me help you. Go for this phone and you won’t be disappointed.",30

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"As of late I've been on something of a ""phone journey"". I first purchased an Idol 3 5.5"", but the phone was just too darn big to be practical (at least for me). I returned it, and then picked up the new Moto G 2015 (which I also did a review on). It was an excellent phone, but in the end I discovered it was missing some key features that I really needed in a daily driver device.First, the Moto G was missing a notification LED. Sure, some of you may think ""who cares, it has Moto display"", but there are times where this just isn't optimal. When the phone was on my desk and I happened to miss a notification (which normally flashed 3 times, but sometimes just once, probably bugged), to find out I even had one I had to either 1.) reach across the desk and wave my hand over the device, 2.) pick it up which would activate the screen (which didn't always work, either), or 3.) physically hit the power button. A notification LED eliminates the need for all of that fuss. That light is going to blink until I check/clear my notifications, for me this is PERFECT!Moto G is also missing a gyroscope. Not overly important to me (most of the time), but this is useful for things such as 360 degree YouTube videos, certain games, etc. Another win for Alcatel!Moto G doesn't include a magnetometer. Wanna use a compass app on the Moto G? Too bad, so sad. Alcatel 3 - Motorola 0.No NFC on the Moto G. Wanna pay using Android Pay in the future? Well, you can't do that with the Moto G! Idol 3 strikes again!Only 8GB internal storage on the similarly priced Moto G. What's that? You want 16GB for 179.99? Don't worry, Alcatel has you covered.Moto G only offers 1GB RAM on the 179.99 model. While 1GB is ""sufficient"" with careful usage, I'll gladly take 1.5GB for the same price, thanks Idol 3!The screen. While their resolutions are the same (1280 x 720), the Idol 3 4.7"" sports a 312 PPI pixel density, while the Moto G only comes in at 294. More pixels? More clarity? Yup! I'll take it!Dual front facing speakers with JBL sound? They sound absolutely amazing. The Moto G at least had the decency to have its only speaker on the front, but there is zero contest here. These speakers sound just as good as the ones from the 5.5"" Idol 3!While there are more positives, I just wanted to lay out the comparisons between the Idol 3 4.7"" and the Moto G 2015 1GB model, as these are the most often compared devices. In my honest opinion, there is zero contest between the two and I feel that Alcatel did an amazing job on this device. At first I was a bit leery of the 1.2Ghz Quad Core CPU, but I've had zero issues with lollipop and everything is buttery smooth! I fully recommend this to anyone, as it is well worth the price of admission!",18

I was looking for a reliable budget smartphone to purchase for my parents, who were learning to use smartphones for the first time. So something basic with a long battery life was ideal. After looking intensively at budget smartphones, I narrowed my choices down to the Alcatel OneTouch or the Moto G (3rd Gen). I was ultimately swayed by the Alcatel because they had the 4.7"" screen size option and I am glad it worked out well.It was very easy to learn and use, great camera, decent battery life, and my mom loves it. The only comment I have to add, is the limited options for changing the language. There were a couple of options, but Chinese was not one of them. If language settings are a top concern for purchasing this phone, I would suggest you to find out what options you would need. (I know the Moto G offers a couple more languages, including Chinese.)

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,3,"So far so good. Needed a stopgap for my old Nexus 5 since the battery has died by noon everyday in recent weeks. I've tried a few of the 5.5"" mid-range phones that have been released recently and none of them seem to be right for me. I just can't seem to get used to using a larger phone. Started using this phone 2 days ago and it's been great so far.No stuttering at all, and has kept the same pace as my Nexus did, yet the battery has lasted albeit with weekend usage. The standby on this phone is Apple-esqe, I left it off the charger overnight and lost 2% of battery life. I'll get a chance to see what normal business use will get me today.The speakers on this phone are some of the best I've ever heard on a smart phone. Loud and clear.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,3,"UPDATE November 2016 -I have downgraded my rating of this phone due to a system update patch dated November 1, 2016. This update kills the functionality of the 'tap to wake' feature that lets you tap on the screen to wake it up. This is a WONDERFUL feature that I loved on this phone. But this feature was largely killed with the November 2016 update. It now only works MAYBE 5% of the time I tap the screen to wake it. This is a REALLY obnoxious killing of a great feature. If Alcatel eliminates great features like this after purchase it eliminates my trust in the company and I would not buy an Alcatel product in the future because of this. I don't particularly care if this was intentional or is just a bug. They sent an update patch that changed something I don't want changed. That's a screw up and I'm not happy.░░░░░GOOD PHONE / OKAY CAMERA░░░░░I got this for my wife to replace the Galaxy S6 we bought a few months ago. Turns out that phone was just too darn big. The Idol 3 4.7"" version ends up being perfectly sized for a normal person’s hand.This is a nice phone in general. It's a great phone when you factor in the price and overall value. With the hardware being so capable for such a reasonable price this phone could be a game changer for the Smartphone industry, forcing the major players to bring pricing down. I said the same thing about the 5.5"" version of the Idol 3 a few months ago and with the popularity that device and the ASUS ZenFone 2 are enjoying in this price range, I am convinced you'll see more reasonably priced phones from the major market players in the next 2 years.░░░░░THE GOOD░░░░░❖ The sound - The front facing JBL speakers make this a solid rival to the HTC One M9. If you use your phone for multi media like watching videos or listening to music without headphones this is a solid sound system for you. The sound is vibrant and most importantly it's loud. And it's clear sound. It doesn't sound like a tiny cell phone speaker. It sounds like a real speaker. The HTC One product line made the front facing speakers it's calling card and no one really challenged the HTC design until now. The Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 stands toe to toe with the HTC One sound and doesn't flinch.❖ It physically looks like a nice phone, not a cheap off brand.❖ It's not the most powerful processor in a Smartphone, and it's a little lower powered than the 5.5"" variant but it's plenty good enough to drive the Idol 3 for normal daily use. I didn't find it to be laggy at all doing normal stuff. Through all of the set up process and a couple hours of use there was no lag.❖ It has expandable storage! Thank you for keeping this feature in a smart phone. I hate the cloud. I want to have my files on my device. The Idol 3 starts at 16GB on board (not all usable as the system takes up some of that) but it's expandable up to 128GB via the tried and true SD card method. So you can expand the storage significantly for $20-$50. Meanwhile some of the higher end Smartphones will charge you more than the entire purchase price of the Idol 3 to increase from a 32GB base model to a 128GB model.❖ The HD 4.7"" display is VERY nice. The colors are vibrant. They may be slightly more vibrant than true life colors, but it works. Photos look richer, even if you don't get true life coloring. All the rendered graphics look fantastic due to the rich color depth. (Meaning stuff like your icons and games and the UI interface, etc etc). The resolution is a little lower than the 5.5"" version, but the screen is also smaller so it's not very noticeable. This phone sas the same resolution as the 30 inch HDTV in my bedroom.❖ The back is flat! I like to lay my phone down on a desk or table next to me and be able to use it for things like checking a sports score or just checking off a notification or something. With a rounded back on the phone it will wobble and be annoying. The Idol 3 has a flat back so it lays flat on the table and doesn't wobble when you touch it. This is such a simple thing but it's HUGE for me.❖ It’s SUPER thin. (See my picture with comparison next to my finger) It’s thinner than my Galaxy S4, with just a slightly smaller screen. (Its’ significantly smaller than screen on the Galaxy S6 we sold) And it’s very light weight.❖ The camera was an initial area of concern for me. Everything looked over exposed and blurry. This was largely fixed with an alternate camera app (more on that later). It's still not the greatest camera in the world, but I have to factor in the price tag on the phone. For $180 it's a good enough camera. In high light (outdoors in day time) it's actually pretty decent. In low light (anytime you need the flash) it's not so hot.░░░░░THE BAD░░░░░❖ The stock camera app is complete garbage in all aspects. You can improve the photo quality a little by adjusting the manual settings, but you lose the settings as soon as you restart the app. It doesn't save them. On the stock settings everything is massively overexposed with the light balance making everything look blue. This almost caused me to return the phone, making me think the camera itself was bad. Plan on using an alternate camera app. I switched to Camera MX for photos. (Available on Amazon, but newer versions on Google Play) Camera MX has a conflict with video on this phone though and simply doesn't work. The stock camera app works okay for video.❖ The battery is not replaceable. They do wear out after a while and I like to keep phones for years and repurpose them for other things after their service life as a phone expires. (As controllers for things, MP3 jukeboxes, etc) I like being able to go on Amazon, spend $20 on a replacement battery and quickly switch it out. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. So no replaceable battery is a problem for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. I sucked it up on this one because it's my wife's phone and she didn't care. But I don't love this industry trend.░░░░░THE BOTTOM LINE░░░░░❖ It EASILY outperforms it's $180 purchase price. It's not the greatest Smartphone of all time, but you cannot beat this phone for $180. I said the same thing about the 5.5"" version's $250 price. The 4.7"" isn't as good of a phone overall as the 5.5"" which has more physical room in the housing to cram in better specs, but for $180 the 4.7"" version is a great value, even with the camera not being an industry leader.❖ Ultimately you have to decide what features are important to you. If you never use the camera or don't use it for anything you want to keep, like maybe you just take pictures of your parking space so you remember where you parked, it's a great smartphone. I love the form factor of it. It's thinness. It's weight. It's display. It's all very nice.❖ Use an alternate camera app that gives you more control over the exposure. An alternate camera app changed my decision to return this phone. I had this as a 4 star review until I had better luck with different apps. I also compared the quality of the photos to the price tag of the phone and realized that it's a great value. You can get a better camera on a phone, but it will cost more to do it. For $180 you really can't go wrong.",115

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5"" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the ""norm"" 5""+ form factor.",6
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"Great product! I'm loving the smaller phone. It's a breath of fresh air from all these phablets and near phablets. I guess I'm in a minority for wanting a smaller phone. Battery life is great and performance is really good. I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5"" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5"" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5"" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"Update 3/07/16:I have moved my rating from a 4 to 5.The TracFone AT&T 4G LTE sim works great at Bodega Bay. So we have good connections in what has been a blackout area for years.I upgraded my text system to the MySms premium for better texting and easier texting pictures to family and friends.I added Camera MX for better picture taking and ease of transmitting pictures with the MySms as noted above. The system works seamlessly with Amazon Prime Photos. Take a picture. In a short time it is on Amazon Prime, and I can text the photos to our friends and family in seconds. I have just scratched the surface with the capabilities of Camera MX, and it surpasses any phone camera or camera I have had in over a decade.The battery continues to be amazing and also eliminates the drain on my Android tablet / Chromebook with the MySyms connection.So this great phone fits in my pockets is powerful and does anything I need or want with the phone, internet connection and camera +4G LTE!The cost of this is about $200.The first part of the below is for Tracfone customers/users. If you don’t use Tracfone, go below the dotted line for my review.For a week, my new Alcatel Idol 3, 4.7 didn’t work with my transferred Tracfone minutes and years of use. The Tracfone site showed that my BYOP transfer had worked with my new BYOP sim card, and all of my minutes, data and time left were transferred. The phone didn’t work to make/receive calls or texts.Alcatel was of no help. A friend suggested that I email Tracfone to set up a phone call with them. I did and got online, with someone as per the email from them. He claimed they didn’t have any of my data. Including tracfone phone # and id #’s. Fortunately, I had made a hard copy of what I had re time and years on my old smartphone and what Tracfone showed with my new Sim cardI told him that I needed to speak with someone, who could help me. Then on hold for 15 minutes, when a nice woman answered and again wanted all the data I had emailed and told the other phone person. After, I re told her the specific data, reading from my hard copy made the day the BYOP was supposedly activated. Then, she said I didn’t have anytime left on my contract, and I need to buy more time. I reminded her of the hard data showing over 2000 minutes and time of agreement for years to come. That was a 30 minute + call process.She said that she had to transfer me to another supervisor. She did, and the new person started asking for my data given twice that call. I said that I had sent all of that in via email, and I had given that data twice on the same phone call. She found my contract and said my phone wasn’t 4.7 working because my time/minutes/data hadn’t been transferred. She did her thing on her end and my phone fired up and I dialed in the code to activate it.It now works with well over one hour on the phone going over same stuff 3 times with Tracfone on line people------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evaluation of this phone is now 5 stars.Before, I got my Tracfone problem corrected, I had used my new phone via wifi to transfer the contacts, pictures and apps from my old android LG phone. Most of this went well. The transfer of stuff from a nearby or close Android (Acer tablet, old Android phone and my Acer Chromebook 15, which I’m using for this report), didn’t work.The wifi reception is good but not as strong as my wife’s Alcatel One Touch Android. Where I use it at home, the wifi reception is strong and very fast.The 4.7” screen fits in my shirt pockets even after the bottom half of the add on hard case was added.The screen size is adequate for what I want to do away from home, to make/receive phone calls and text/receive and check texts and emails. I will use my Acer 8 tablet or my Chromebook for more involved keyboard/screen work at home.The battery, so far is adequate so far for my uses. Last night it was @ ¾ charge, and I didn’t charge it. This morning it was still @ ¾ charged and again at 2 pm this afternoon. When, I picked it up again and turned it on it was still at 3/4.Bloatware is at a minimum.It accepted my 64 gig card with no fuss.The Android 5.0 seems to be smoother and less drag than our previous 4.?.It works smoothly with MY SMS which I have on my tablet and Chromebook.Also, when you receive a phone call, you don’t push or make contact directly with the phone Icon. You have slide that Icon to the right to answer. I have had cell phones since the 1990’s, and that is different.Since the phone is now working with Tracfone, I have to push the app buttons on the screen harder than before.The glass add on screen I bought is too big. The standard screen gets very messy very quickly with minimal useage. I will try to find an aftermarket glass that fits.The combo hard case and belt case (extra buy) is a mixed picture. The hard case fits fairly well;however if you attach that to the other half of the hard case, you can’t really get the camera out to make phone calls, receive them or to take a picture. You have to remove the part that covers the phone and the back part of the case. I missed two phone calls from my wife due to this time delay to get to the front of the phone. Also, I didn’t get a picture of some on the move wildlife in our area due to this problemIf you use Tracfone BYOP, and your phone doesn’t work. Don’t waste your time contacting Alcatel. Send Tracfone an email with your data and tell them your phone isn’t working. Tracfone will send you an email with a phone# and a numeric code to use. When you, make that call, sit in a comfortable chair and have a hardline phone available, all of your data available, a bottle of water, a lot of patience, and your well charged Alcatel Idol 3. I used my Acer Chromebook to help with the data, the “lost” data and other stuff they needed.In this short time, I think that Alcatel and Tracfone have a good winning combo. If you use Tracfone’s BYOP, and you are an established customer wanting to transfer your minutes and time, be sure to make hard copies of your minutes and data. You will probably need that data.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update re the battery. It is an excellent battery with heavy use. It is the best cell phone battery, we have ever owned re standby. It holds the charge in standby versus our other androids phones and tablets using the battery charge overnight or just standing unplugged.Re wifi connections. It quickly recognizes our home wifi and connects and other hot spots seamlessly. Its wifi range in our house isn't as good as my wife's Alcatel One Touch Popup, which is incredible re its wifi range. However, since I never use these phones in our bedroom and a few other weak wifi areas, that is not an issue. The auto switch from wifi to Tracfone 4G LTE like going from our family room to our back yard is auto and seamless. So far the Tracfone/AT&T 4G LTE in our area is very strong and reliable. Hopeoufully, we can try the AT&T 4G LTE in/on our coastal areas where our Verizon/Trackfone coverage is zero.The Android 5.? seems to be more reliable and easier to do simple things with versus the Android 4.?'s.",1

It takes 3x longer to do anything you need to do on this phone. The keyboard is not responsive and poorly calibrated, the speakers aren't great, and there are no compatible apps that compare to Motorola assist. Making phone calls takes about three extra steps, and I rarely am able to make or receive calls due to poor reception. I would blame that on the phone service company, but my boyfriend and I are on a family plan and he gets reception when I don't.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,4,"Have only owned it for about a week. Battery saver is excellent for me but if you're walking around with the phone in your pocket, it will detect motion and may not sleep as you might expect. Mine sits on a table much of the day and so it sleeps soundly. :-) Speakers are nice JBL but bass response is still lacking which is inherent in the extremely thin design of this phone. You may need to install an equalizer to reduce mid and high frequencies for a richer sound. I would have given 5 stars except that there is a small ""sweet spot"" when listening on a phone call. If the phone is not placed just so on the ear, the volume is reduced significantly. I think it just takes some practice. The dual speakers and dual microphones work beautifully for quickly answering phone upside down if necessary. FM radio will not run unless earphones are plugged in as they act as an antenna. Display is perfect for me. Some built in wallpapers look pixelated but they're probably just crappy samples. As you'll see with Android 5, you cannot have a different wallpaper on your lock screen. So much for using it as a quick flashlight like I did with my old phone.Android 5 does come with a flashlight hidden in the SECOND pull-down notification menu with the Bluetooth and WiFi buttons. The flashlight is not an ""app"". Note: WiFi does NOT turn on using the ""WiFi Display"" app. You must use either the settings menu or the second pull down menu to do that. This phone has an auto-dimming screen which also automatically brightens to max when in sunlight. VERY nice feature but you may find that a nearby light source in a dark room could fool the sensor and make it dimmer than you want it. Just adjust the angle of the screen so that the sensor detects the light and the screen will brighten accordingly. You can also turn this feature off.This is not a ""department store"" brand. They are sold at T-Mobile stores and I was told by a clerk that the Idol 3 is really nice and they don't have it to sell because they were sent a lesser version by corporate.Almost forgot to mention the most important thing; This phone is an upgrade from my 3 year old Samsung which was loading pages agonizingly slow. This Alcatel with Android 5 and LTE loads pages almost instantly! AND this phone is eligible for the Android 6 Marshmallow upgrade as soon as it is available. No luck yet trying to upgrade but I love it! Marshmallow will allow you to override permissions for each app. Other than that, not much change.If you sign up for an Amazon Signature card like I did, you can get an extra $50. off this phone. BEWARE: Amazon automatically changes your default payment method to the new card! If you don't want that, go to your settings and change it back to your old card. Also, the phone must be purchased with the Amazon card to get the discount. So remember to pay off the card right away if you don't want interest charged. You have 21 days grace period. I've had this card before. Keep an eye on your default payment before you check out because it was changed on me once before without my knowledge before making a purchase. One-click ordering is what caused it to happen to me as it does not give you an opportunity to see your default payment method.",1

The iPhone wake button is much better placed. I also do not like that you have to bring up settings and then ringtones and then scroll to None click on it and then click OK to turn off the ringer and use only vibrate, here again the iPhone has it beat hands down with the little switch on the side.Now the Pros: The screen is really nice and much easier to keep clean that the iPhone, the operating system has IPhone beat hands down, the speaker system is really much more that I expected from a device this small and, to top it off you can answer it from either end with the reversible microphone.

Over all this phone rates about a solid 95%.I am using it on Wal-Mart's family plan which is serviced by T-Mobile and the signal is not quite as good as Verizon was with my old iPhone but it the service is acceptable for what I use it for. I do feel tho it would be stronger on AT&T snd I may at some point switch to them but for now it is serving my purposes well.",3
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,4,"I've had ZTE AWE, LG G2, iPhone 5s, Idol 3 5.5"" and now Idol 3 4.7"".This phone is slim, light, and perfect size for the pocket and web browsing. The Idol 5.5"" was too large to keep comfortably in my pocket without breaking it.The screen has a yellower white, which I like better for reading. The screen of the Idol 5.5"" had a bright bluish white, which often hurt my eyes. Both screens are very reflective - remedied by a MATTE screen protector by Mr. Shield.The battery is 2000 mAh, which to my surprise is sufficient to stream Pandora on 4G the whole day. I always thought that I needed 3000 mAh for a whole day operation but the new version of Android is surprisingly battery efficient.The sound from the phone speakers is loud and clear with some depth, but definitely not with super bass or ""like from big speakers"", as some reviews are claiming. Strangely, the ringing and notifications are decreased in volume when headphones are plugged in - definitely a software bug that Alcatel has to straighten out.While the sound through the on-board speakers is good, JBL did an exceptionally poor job with the sound enhancement through headphones, for which I am removing one star. Most cheap earbuds (less than $20) that I tried with the Idol 3 sounded with weak bass. Turning on the JBL ""audio effects"" attempts to create surround sound by distancing/depressing the mid frequencies, corresponding to human voices. That results in decreased clarity and ""muddy"" sound. The included JBL earphones were the worst from the bunch I tried with no clear highs and a complete lack of bass. I would not pay even $5 for those. Only the earbuds that came with my iPhone 5s had crystal clarity and after I pumped the bass with the Bass Booster app, the sound became acceptable and listening to Pandora enjoyable.A pleasant surprise was the back (13 Mpx) f/2.0 aperture camera, which is the same in the 4.7"" and the 5.5"" models. Its Automatic mode takes good pics in good light. The Automatic is not smart enough in low light so I turn on the Manual mode, set timer to 5s to avoid camera shake, and ISO to about 800. With these manual settings, I was able to get sharp selfies (can see my skin pores) without much noise even in very dim light (indoors, early in the morning on a cloudy day). In comparison, the iPhone 5s automatic mode rarely produced sharp pics in dim light (like indoors during the day), while LG G2 got them but smeared all fine details like eyelashes and skin pores due to agressive noise reduction. The pics that I get with the Idol 3 come out with colors close to what my eyes see with slight saturation of reds. In comparison, LG G2 had a tendency to produce washed out (bluer) pics.In terms of everyday tasks, the 4.7"" Idol 3 is just as fast as the 5.5"" version, and is even faster in the animation when you close all open apps and they slide off the screen one by one. The 5.5"" version stutters in that ?! The 4.7"" Idol 3 has slower processor on specs but has to control fewer screen pixels or is better optimized. I rarely play games on phones so can't compare the two phones in that department. Both phones stutter when browsing the DESKTOP version of image-intensive web pages like Amazon but even my powerful desktop computer does that. It has more to do with downloading all the images and the site programming than with how fast the phone video processor is. The occasional slight stutter does not defray from pleasant web browsing.",13

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,4,"Unlocked phones were never this good before. As a phone it works great. The camera is good in daylight, not so good in dark settings, but for the price that's fair. The screen itself looks very good, way better than the run of the mill budget phones. The speakers are fantastic. Alcatel has a partnership with JBL and you get a very decent set of JBL earbuds included. The most obvious con to me is the speed, which is just OK. This is why I docked a star, although for the price this is as much as you can expect.This phone runs a close to pure version of android 5.02. When you first power on the phone, it prompts you to download a software update that takes care of the stagefright vulnerability.If you are on T-Mobile, this phone has band 12.Although the phone lets you uninstall some apps, one app that can't be uninstalled and can't be disabled is the music player. I like to use another music player app and I have to be careful that I don't turn the factory one on by mistake, or else I'll have 2 different songs playing at the same time.I've noticed that if I'm holding the phone upside down (ie, if I'm reading lying down) when I click the screen, it might not take. But if I'm just holding the phone in my hand with the screen facing up (which is the normal way) then it works every time.All in all, I have only minor nits to pick and I think this to be an all around solid phone. Even if you don't buy this phone, don't automatically buy a phone from a carrier....shop around and you can find more for your money.",4

Its not the music app, because I checked it, it wasn't playing anything, then I closed it and all other open apps and the music continued. It must have been streaming since I didn't have that music, yet it was a completely different genre from the last playlist I streamed. Often when I unlock my phone and start doing stuff the music stops, but not always.Still an OK phone if you have no money. I'm hoping this is an isolated incident and will try to replace my phone.",2

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,3,"Received firmware updates since I bought it, making it much MUCH better than when it first arrived, IMO. But the weird thing is sometimes I pull it out of my pocket and it's jus a black screen. No matter how many times I hit the power button it won't wake up or turn on - I have to hold the power button for 10 seconds to reset it. This has happened through multiple firmware versions. Also, the auto-brightness has a tendency to stay bright and melt my eyes at night.The screen quality is nice, but over time I'm starting to be able to see something behind the screen - not sure if they're individual LEDs or if they're related to the digitizer / touch sensor or what, they look like small rings (although I will admit this phone has already taken a beating and I don't protect it with a case since it was an inexpensive device).Overall, though, the speed and responsiveness are nice. It's not the best device I've ever owned, but for the price I paid, I'm not too unhappy The speakers are fairly impressive, and they can get nice and loud on their own. In the end, it's VERY light and thin and that is impressive, but there are probably more impressive phones available for less money if you want something that was a flagship a few years ago. The downside to those is, you might not end up with Marshmallow, like this phone has been upgraded to.6.0.1. If you leave it at the stock 5.x that it came with, you're probably going to be very disappointed in this phone - I know I wasn't impressed with it at all until the firmware update arrived.",0

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"We bought two of these phones (at full price, so this is an actual customer review, not one that may be biased by having received it for free or at a discount) a few months ago and still really love them. We spent quite a bit of time researching all of the options available both above and below this price range, and this phone looked to be a great value, and it really is. We are very pleased with our purchase. We use it with T-Mobile on one of their pre-paid plans and have had a very good experience with the phone and T-Mobile. We are also going to be traveling outside the country, and this phone comes unlocked and supports all of the bands that we need.Pros: The screen looks great, and is very bright and crisp. The camera takes very nice pictures and video. The phone fits nicely in the hand and looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. The build quality is excellent. We charge them after a couple days of normal use, so the battery seems to last a respectable amount of time. The sound, as other reviewers have mentioned, is just excellent. This thing can really put out some sound, and gone are the days of not being able to hear your phone ring! Playing music on it sounds great, and is stereo (one speaker at each end of the phone). The phone is reversible, with a microphone and speaker at each end, so it doesn't matter which way its facing when you pick it up to answer it, the phone will just take care of it based on the orientation using the gyro sensor. This isn't really a must have feature, but it is kind of nice. It plays videos (such as YouTube) very well, and it feels very smooth and responsive in every app we've tried. The value for the money is great, and we would still be very happy with it if we paid more.Cons:Wish it supported dual sim cards instead of just one, but you get a microSD card spot instead, so not too bad and most people probably only need one sim card slot anyway.Wish the volume could be adjusted in smaller increments, but this isn't the phone's fault, it's an android thing and not a deal breaker at all.In closing, we are very pleased with our purchase of two of these phones and would quickly and happily buy them again. If you are looking for a great unlocked GSM phone and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, then give this one a try. We highly recommend it!",3

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"This seems to be a great little phone.When I saw it would cost $700 to get a new Samsung to replace my old S3, I shopped around. I bought the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7"") from Amazon and after a week am pretty much thrilled at how well it works.The setup had some bumps for me because my cloud files were not up to date. My advice here is to update your contacts, files (including downloads), and pictures before cluttering the new phone with junk So don't log in to your Google acount (yes, even just for email) until stuff is updated and synch'ed up on the old phone.Also, perhaps because the Alcatel phone is ""unlocked"" and is not a service provider's proprietary device, it does not wake up in your hand knowing how to handle internet data. When you enter an in-range WiFi password, the Internet will work fine. To get it to work when you do NOT have WiFi, you will need to setup the mobile networks. This might be as easy as selecting your; provider in settings:(wireless networks - more - mobile networks - access point names - and then either select yourprovider.) You might need to enter the info manually if your provider is not listed. I found listings online by searching for ""AT&T Alcatel APN settings"" but didn't need it because my carrier is AT&T and there was a preconfigured choice as I described earlier.The ""unlocked"" feature is great because it means the phone works with SIM chips from any provider. So if I switch from AT&T to Verizon, Sprint, or any other service provider, this phone will work instantly as soon as I insert the chip. Also, if I travel to a foreign country -- in addition to being able to function on multiple networks --, I will be able to buy a chip for any country and put it into my own phone. If you have travelled, you know what I am talking about. Using your own phone is wonderful in foreign countries.NOTE: My phone accepted a memory chip in addition to the SIM; I see you CAN get a dual SIM option; which I do not understand. The little chip carrier can removed by pushing a paper clip into the tiny hole on the left side of the phone. The little tray slides all the way out. The chips do not fit snugly, but must be sort of balanced or set carefully and then inserted gently. I was actually surprised when it worked because the whole process seemed to require more faith than skill. The phone is so small and compact, it is easy to forgive this space saving compromise.I haven't compared the camera, but it seems fine. I got accustomed to popping the back off my Samsung and just dropping in a newly charged battery, but the Alcatel is sealed. I guess if the battery dies I will need to send it in for service or just replace the whole thing.In general, I think there are enough good reasons to give this phone a try and it is a low risk. Alcatel also makes a 5.5"" phone, so if you want a bigger unit, it's an option.I know this sounds almost evangelical, but I do pay attention to details. Seems like a winner to me.",1

This is coming from someone who was using one of the largest phablets around in the Sony Xperia Z Ultra.It offers a nice compact clean design asthetic, great dual front facing speakers and a lil touch of customization (mainly icons and a few apps) on top of stock Android 5.0.2 as of writing this review.The processing package had me concerned at first but once you actually use the device and tailor it your liking, you realize how snappy and responsive it really is. My only complaint is that Alcatel didn't go all out and create enough accessories for this phone, it's kinda difficult to find a decent case for it but I enjoy the design language so much that I'm willing to just go 'naked' with this one.In conclusion, I'm very happy with my purchase and may consider buying the 5.5 inch sibling down the road.",1

That is where the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7"" comes into play. It is the PERFECT SIZE. The only thing big about this phone is the name! Good specs for somebody who just needs a phone for normal use. Yes, it is not the fastest phone out there but for the money, you CAN'T beat it!

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,2,I purchased the 4.7 version after having the 5.5 for 2wks. I wanted to see if the smaller version would be the larger version in smaller packaging. I was a bit disappointed because battery life is my most important feature in any device. The screen was also not as stunning as the larger. For the price it's a decent phone but I was not purely impressed. I still have the 5.5 version and have very little negative remarks. It's definitely large which is the only thing I don't like. I wouldn't recommend the 4.7 version over other budget phones.,3
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"My day to day phone is a Samsung Note 4, so I wanted a smaller phone for times when the Samsung is just too large. I've only had the Idol for a day, but for most people who don't do serious gaming on a cell, it's a great bargain. It's very light, the software is basically stock Android so it's quite snappy, and the screen is satisfactory. Battery life seems to be ok, with enough power to last a whole day and charging is quite quick. The only real negatives I see is that the SIM/MicroSD card tray is a pain to use (which will only be an issue for those who swap phones a lot) and Wifi is 2.4 only (not 5). No, there is no way that this can be compared with a high end phone, but for the price it will do everything that probably 98% of phone users need. It will be interesting to see how many peopple keep buying $700 high-end phones now that American cell phone companies aren't playing the subsidy game anymore and people realize how much their free or $199 phone really costs.",2
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"Though it's only been 24 hours, I am super impressed by the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7 inch smartphone (name is terrible though). This is a great time for affordable, mid-range, unlocked, no-contract smartphones. This phone slots in between the two models of the 3rd generation Moto G. Other than the RAM (1.5 GB vs 2 GB), it's very similar in specs to the more expensive Moto G model but at the price of the less expensive Moto G model (for now). I bought the Alcatel instead of the Moto G because it has a smaller, sleeker design (4.7 inch vs 5.0 inch screen and half as thin) and terrific front-facing stereo speakers. The screen is sharp and the speakers are very loud! The Idol 4.7 looks similar to the old Google Nexus 4, which I owned, but slimmer and sleeker (and more plasticy). It's a little smaller than an iPhone 6 despite having the same screen size, and about as thin. The Moto G has much more durable build and is waterproof, and I suspect, better support. Both the Alcatel and the Moto G make great backup or travel phones, and also starter smartphones for teens. They can also be very solid everyday phones for most consumers. As the wireless companies move away from contracts and subsidizing phones, I wonder whether more folks will start moving to some of the mid-range phones. Many folks have been paying $600-800 every two years for new phones without really knowing it. Perhaps Apple will be safe with its high-end clientele--at least for now--but companies like Samsung are very vulnerable. These $200 phones are more than good enough for the typical user--with performance comparable to the flagship phones from two years ago. I worry a bit about durability given the materials it's made out of. I should probably buy a case, but the phone is so sleek and attractive that I kind of don't want to put one on. Five stars for the amazing value! The Quality to price ratio for this phone is terrific.",3
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"This phone has blown away my expectations. In a world full of phablets and cell phones that seem to just be getting larger and larger (and more and more expensive as well), it's becoming seemingly harder and harder to find a small phone that will actually perform. This phone does just that, and does it well.Initially I had owned an LG G4. I thought about it and realized, man this is insane that I am spending $600+ on a cell phone. I decided to return the LG G4 and give the Alcatel Idol 3 5.5 a try. While I loved the phone, it was still larger than I was hoping, and the 4.7 had not yet been released. Then one day I checked Amazon, and the 4.7 was out, so I made the exchange (and I couldn't be happier).People may complain about the specs when compared to some current flagship phones. Are they as good? No. But here's the thing, just a year and a half ago or so, if you saw the specs on this phone, they would have blown you away. Think about the flagship phones from a year or two ago. Were they bad, slow, etc? No, they were top of the line. This phone has the same specs, if not better, that those phones had. That being said, I have not experienced a single hiccup with this phone yet. No lag when switching screens or apps, no delay in taking pictures, no freezing or apps crashing. So ask yourself, do I really NEED a phone with specs that the $600-900 phones are offering?Pros:Screen - It's beautiful. Is it 1080P? No, and it doesn't need to be. At 4.7"" 720P is gorgeous, and looks just as nice as my LG G4 did. Know what is awesome about the screen being 720P? Battery life. The ""lower"" resolution will greatly improve battery life.Sound - The JBL front facing stereo speakers are magnificent. The sound is very loud, and very clear. Watching music videos, listening to music, and even the alarm are all very impressive with the volume and clarity. The JBL headphones that come with the phone also have excellent sound and come with different size earbuds to ensure a good fit.Speed - It's fast. There's no lag when switching apps, browsing the web, multitasking, sending emails, etc. One review I read elsewhere of the phone stated that when typing, the phone would sometimes lag and have to ""catch up"" to his typing. I am a very fast typer, and I have yet to experience this, so YMMV.Size - Perfect. Everything can be done with one hand. It fits well in your palm. Very thin.Camera - 13MP rear, and 5MP front. Both take excellent photos. Most importantly to me, they both take photos QUICKLY. I have a one year old, and having to wait 2-3 seconds after pressing the capture button will often times make me miss the shot, or have them end up blurry. The Idol 3 takes it almost instantly 95% of the time.Battery Life - Very impressed. Having the ""slower"" processor, and the ""lower resolution"" screen, both help to improve the battery life greatly. I have been using the phone pretty much non stop since getting it. I am a heavy texter, social media user, and I use the music player with both a bluetooth speaker and a bluetooth stereo headset for 2+ hours a day. I have been setting the phone up and redownloading all the apps on my previous phones, so I have been on it constantly. End of the day it still has plenty of charge left to it. I imagine the average user will have no problem getting through a day, and a heavy user may be able to as well.Cost - Can't be beat, obviously. $179 for this phone is an absolute steal.Cons:Brand - Not because Alcatel is bad, but because it isn't popular. This means little 3rd party support for accessories and whatnot. Currently the only tempered glass screen protector available on Amazon is by Mr. Shield, and the fitment is very poor. There are not a lot of cases available at this time. Hopefully this will change as more people realize what a gem this phone is and actually start buying it.Overall, this phone is amazing and well worth your money. I can't imagine what you would be doing that requires a phone that costs $600 more than this phone, honestly. The size is perfect, it's fast, the sound is incredible, and the battery life has been awesome. Alcatel has a real winner in this phone. The only competition I see at this price point would be the new Moto G, however I love the form factor and design of the Alcatel.",11
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,1,"Amazon service is excellent. Hence this review deserves atleast 1 star.I heard about this model in Feb 2015 when it was announced in CES. I was very much interested just because of form factor (I am not a fan of 5+"" and hefty phones). Was waiting to buy since then.. I think it was released in UK region in June then in US in September. Considering 5.5"" phone was priced at $199 for initial launch, I was hoping 4.7"" will be priced at $150 but it didnot. But I bought at for 180+ tax anyway.1) Though it was good initial days, battery drain (10% in 10 mins during non-usage of phone) and constant reboot (especially using camera) made me to return and get second phone.2) Second phone did not turn on et all. Did a factory reset and was able to turn on. Worked fine for 3-4 days and alas again same problem as above. Could not resist to return it back. Amazon is good in this process and hence I would buy from Amazon knowing my purchases are protected.For some days in October, this product was not available. There was notice ""there is some problem in inventory.. we will let you know when resolved"".. Not sure I got two defective items. I did noticed few good feedback on this phone here but somehow both phones didnt work for me. Good buy Alcatel.",2
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"This was a replacement after my alcatel idol 3 5.5 was stolen. I didn't like the 5.5 due to it's size and had been thinking about replacing it, but couldn't justify buying another phone for no reason. I always found the 5.5 a bit too large for my hands and for my pockets.The 4.7 is perfect for my hands but is slightly slower than the 5.5. The slowdown is barely noticeable, this phone also doesn't have a release yet for the latest version of android, however it works perfectly out of the box for everything I do. This phone has no bloatware other than an antivirus program and a couple of other small apps that are easily removed. It's about as pure of an android experience as you'll get out of the box. For the price, build quality and general ease of use, I highly recommend this for anyone who isn't into iphones.",2

Below are the issues I'm facing 1. Battery sucks big time, I made sure I had 100% battery before I went to bed and morning the reading on batter power was just 37% left. There was no activity on the phone but battery drains for no reason. 2. LTE never worked so far (Please don't argue, I was able to get LTE speed with other cell phone with the same service provider) and also network drops and gets back again,this never happened with my age old android phone. 3 Phone's performance sucks, hard to believe that the configuration they have mentioned can choke to perform with hardly 2 applications installed newly with the phone(I have no games in phone and I just bought this phone 2 days back)PS: The outlook of the phone looks good and the sound is good (Thanks to JBL) but I'm surprised that amazon sells very cheap below par phone which don't perform as per the description. I love to shop with amazon with some confidence but not with doubts.****************************************************Update - things turned worse to worst!!!Below is the email sent to Amazon.I have issue with my phone it's not connecting with my phone network. From the day two when I got this phone I'm having issue with battery and I have also registered for return but unfortunately I didn't return due to circumstance now the situation is really worse as I'm not seeing signal reception with this phone. My friends, office colleagues and my manager started complaining that most of the time my call was hitting the voice mail, initially I thought it was an issue with my carrier but last month I figured out its the problem with the phone and now for the last couple of weeks this phone is not even attempting to connect, I'm using my 2009 Samsung basic smart phone now, with which I'm able to place and receive calls. It's a real nightmare and I have lost important interview calls as well because of this Alcatel phone. I have taken pictures for ref. Comparing my old Samsung and this Alcatel phone, but I'm unable to add here. Please help me on this regard. I just bought this phone because it was sold by Amazon by itself. Thanks!",8

Final note: dual front speakers with the clearest and loudest I've owned on a phone. I had it on an external Bluetooth speaker and when switched to the phone speakers several people didn't believe me. Boom.

It just died after five weeks and now ALCATEL will not return our calls to their customer service. We cannot get the information we need about the phone for the warranty because ALCATEL asks for numbers off the back that DO NOT EXIST on this model so I cannot send the phone in for service. It is great to get a one year warranty when the company IGNORES YOU so that they do not have to honor the warranty. They might as well offer a life-time warranty.

This was one of only TWO budget smartphones i found. Yes, TWO. I almost bought the nexus 5x, but then i saw you could update this to Android 6. That's when I bought it. It has a very nice, vivid, bright display, and the JBL speakers are good and loud. It has decent battery life, especially if you just watch an occasional YouTube video. 4G LTE works well, and its fast on wifi too. I get hi fps on Riptide GP 2 on high settings, and most other games and 360 video work well. If you really want an immersive experience with a small price tag, this is the phone I would recommend. Oh btw, update to Android 6 before you activate a service plan. I had to tweak APN settings after the update to keep using the phone service. It's just less hassle.

Gaming is also fun and the reversible OS a bomb! I have placed in another order to replace my missing phone already. Love the volume key as the camera shutter, it makes taking multiple shots so much easier and convenient. Camera can even be activated when screen is locked without unlocking the phone. Finally, I love the eye unlock but it is difficult using this feature at night or with insufficient light, which is complemented by another option (I.e pin code). Tried to lock phone many times by turning it over but never seemed to get this right, will try again though. Did not have much time to experiment with all the features of the phone before loosing it, but will surely spend more time with the next one. Too bad the 4.7 inch is single sim, I would have loved a dual sim 4.7 in. Also, I wished the inbuilt radio was wireless (could play without inserting the earpiece jack).

I have had Iphone 4s, and Iphone 5s in the past. The reason I had iPhone in the past was its reliability and battery life. However, I had to switch to another phone when I broke my iPhone (I did not want to pay a premium price to get another phone) and was looking for an option with the best value for money.Alcatel one touch idol 3 4.7"" is a hidden gem. So far, I am EXTREMELY happy with the phone. The image quality is superb even though it has 720p screen resolution. I did not find any difference with iPhone or any higher resolution phone. In fact its the vibrant screen makes it so much more appealing than the rather neutral iPhone. Next, the sound quality of the speakers. Just Wow! Can't believe this phone has incredible speakers. Love watching netflix, youtube or listening to music in my phone. My wife cannot figure out if the sound is coming from the cell phone or the television. The next most important factor is the battery in this phone. Till now, I have observed that its life is as good as iPhone. This phone has more juice left towards the end of the day than an iPhone. I am surprised but thats the fact. Though the phone drains more battery when the navigation App is used, but again I won't complain about it. The Apps start and run very fine. There had been some occasion, when the app may not fire up. In that case, I would just free up the memory and it would work fine. This is hardly a concern.Another best feature of this phone is the form factor. The phone is so thin, that it immediately draws attention. Besides being thin, it very light and I do not feel it in my pocket. 4.7"" is the perfect size for the phone. Its not too big and not too small. Perfect for reading, watching, chatting and other day to day activities. I love this phone!I can't believe I had been wasting my money on iPhones when I had so much better option. Android really gives you a much better option to customize with widgets. I would suggest a new user to spend sometime to personalize this phone with better wallpaper, widgets, changing the default options for apps. Then you will love it as much as I do. Go for it and I would bet you will be amazed.",39

The fact that it has 16GB of space and 1.5GB of RAM makes it really worth the money when compared to other phones in this price range (most have 8GB of space or only 1GB of RAM).

The only other complaint that I have is how the photos look when taken indoors. While this still could be user error as I have only had the phone for about a week, the colors while taken inside seem to be a bit on the yellow side and not quite as sharp as I had hoped. Outdoor photos are wonderful, however! Another issue I have with the phone is with texting. While using the speech-to-text, if I need to correct an error, the very last word I say is repeated when I attempt to erase it. Not a big deal but it bugs me that I can't figure out why it does this.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,2,"Received in box: Phone, sim tray tool, charger w/ cord, JBL in-ear headphones w/ variety of tips, and multi-language manual.Let me start this review by stating that I've had cell phones for nearly 20 years. I always tend to go ""middle of the road"" with my phone models, keep them 1-2 years, then get a new one. No flagships, but no junk, either. I've had LG, Samsung, Moto, etc. Most of the big players in the American market. I've never had an iPhone. I mention this to give a frame of reference on how my experience with cell phones was formed.When I was shopping for a phone, I just happened across this one. I had heard of Alcatel before, but never really considered any of their phones. The reviews of this particular model all seemed favorable, and at this price-point it seemed like a really solid choice. I won't re-hash the basic specs that you can read all over the internet, but I'll touch on some things that I've noted and liked/disliked:First impression of the phone: It has a very nice look about it. It's very thin and very light in the hand. The whole face of the unit is glass, and the sides are chromed plastic that give a pretty high-quality look, overall. No complaints.The phone comes with a surprisingly nice set of JBL in-ear headphones with mic and controller. I don't personally like this style of earbuds, but I did try them out and was definitely pleased with the sound quality of music, videos, and phone calls.After inserting my sim and SD cards, and charging up for a bit, I turned on the unit. It walked me through a pretty standard set-up routine, then I let it update Android, and put my usual apps on it. After a bit of personalization and sorting out un-used apps, this thing was ready to go. All the while, I noticed how nice the screen was and how apps popped open quickly, and just the overall positive impression the phone gave me.My observations:-To me the most important thing with a cell phone is... its ability to function like a phone. It seems weird to feel the need to state this, but I bet a lot of people rarely actually call people and talk to them w/ their cell phones. I have T-Mobile, and while I generally don't have reception issues, my neighborhood actually seems to be pretty spotty and my last phone would often drop calls in certain sections of my neighborhood. In my house, I would often have to use my wi-fi to make calls. The Alcatel works better than any other phone I've tried. It never dropped calls, crystal clear reception and people that I've talked to said it sounded like my calls were as clear as a landline.-The speakers on the Alcatel are really quite good, considering the size. Music sounds really nice on the speakers, and the output to headphones is above average. I like that there are 2 speakers, one at either end of the phone. Gives a bit of stereo effect if you're watching a video.-The picture quality of the screen is quite nicer than I expected. Colors are good, images seem decently sharp. Not as nice as a Galaxy, or iPhone, but... look at the price difference. I watched a bunch of Netflix, Youtube, etc. and I was really impressed overall.-I found the size of the unit to be almost perfect for me. I actually am a very tall guy, big hands, etc. and you would think that I'd like a bigger phone, but honestly, I like to be able to put the phone in my pocket, or be able to access all of the functions with one hand. Overall, it's just convenient for me to have this size. I really wish that phone manufacturers would settle down with making ever-larger phones and make some quality ones in this size.-The battery life is very good. I am not exactly a ""heavy user"" but I do make calls, check emails, check Twitter, and watch the occasional vid. I don't really do games, aside from the occasional solitaire. I leave the wifi and GPS on 24/7. I easily got over a day before needing to charge. If I had particularly light usage during a day and didn't watch any video, I could go nearly 40 hours before needing to plug-in.-I am not any kind of expert on Android's different iterations. I don't tweak my phones, or run different ROMS or anything like that. I can say that this phone's OS/ skin/ whatever didn't bug me. It just worked. No complaints. Seemed like standard Android fare that I'm used to, and nothing raised any flags for me. Just a decent system with things doing what I expected them to do.-The cameras, both front and back, are pretty good, I think. I take a lot of pictures for work and hobbies, but not for ""portraits"" or anything like that, more record-keeping. My requirements are pretty low. I can say that with good lighting, the rear camera took very nice pictures. If you're used to phones in this price range, the cameras are going to seem pretty normal. Nothing bad to report, just a solid camera.As for what I didn't like about the phone:-This is very subjective, and not really a big deal (actually it's bordering on silly of me, if I'm being honest): the power button was on the left side andthe volume rocker was on the right. This is opposite of every other phone I've had. I was constantly turning the phone off when I had been intending to change the volume. As I said, not a big deal, but just something I thought I'd mention.**AND NOW FOR WHY I RATED THIS 2 STARS:**-The astute reader will note that most of this is written in the past tense. I have returned the phone. As much as I like nearly everything about this phone, I experienced a deal-breaking problem with two of these.My first phone had a stuck pixel in the lower right section of the screen. When viewing lighter colors on the screen, it wasn't terribly noticeable. But when viewing darker materials or movies, or whatever, it really stuck out. I guess I'm pretty lucky in that I've never had a phone with any kind of problems, but I'm realistic. I know problems slip through the cracks sometimes. I just figured it was ""my turn"" to get a bad one. No big deal. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime, right? So I sent it back, and ordered another one. After a day or two of using the new phone, I noticed that the screen had a problem in roughly the same area as the other one, though it was a different problem. Lower right hand side of the screen. When running my finger across the screen, I'd get a distortion in that spot like when you press a flatscreen too hard. I wasn't pressing too hard, though. No different than any other area of the screen. While this defect was much less bothersome than the stuck pixel, it was still a problem, and I figured it would only get worse with time. So, back it went while it was still under the return period for Amazon.So, overall, I cannot recommend this particular phone. I really wanted to like it, but the fact that it had a screen problem on two of them in the same spot kind of spooked me off of it. I will keep my eye on the Alcatel Idol series and may try it again someday, as I really was impressed with so many aspects of this phone.",4

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,4,"I have no desire to give up this phone! Everything has made me happy so far. Sound Quality: the sound is amazing for a cell phone and perhaps its most bright quality. There are dual front speakers which produce LOUD, crystal clear music. You wouldn't think a phone could have the capability to have professional sound. Out of all the phones I've tested, this phone wins first place award for sound.Battery Charge: The battery is decent. I use the phone heavily and charge the phone about once a night, which is reasonable. Of course, if you're browsing the web and watching videos, the battery drains very quickly. But if you're listening to Spotify or something and put the phone on lock, the battery would last a much longer time. With light use, I've gone 2-3 days without charging the phone.Storage: 16GB is great. I've downloaded 10+ apps with ease, not to mention my picture Gallery which probably contains thousands of photos and a music library with maybe 200 songs. Most phones at this price contain a lower amount of storage.Durability: Unfortunately, this phone's glass is much more fragile since it does NOT use Gorilla Glass like many smartphones. I've had a few average drops which caused my tempered glass screen protector to crack. If you buy this phone, you MUST have a tempered glass screen protector.Overall, I love this phone and believe I will keep it for a long time. I highly recommend you purchase it. It's definitely worth paying more than $180 for! It has lots of storage, awesome sound, a very attractive & sleek design, good enough battery, and more.",2

I wanted something smaller and this 4.7"" IDOL 3 is perfect for me. The only downside is the new firmware installed on it which locked the boot-loader. I was hoping to flash a custom ROM on it, but so far unsuccessful. Can get root access to remove apps that are useless to me, but not many of those anyway. Very simple launcher interface with limited customization features Alcatel (TCL) gives us. Custom launcher is the answer to that (i'm using MIUI which I like personally, it gives me more customization options and its free). I would actually go with Huawei P8 Light instead (MIUI, design, and hardware) but it's missing this one Band frequency that i need to use overseas sometimes. P8 Light is my first choice for the phone under $200 to use in the States, but IDOL 3 is truly Global. That's the only reason it's not P8 light on the other end of the line of whoever is talking to me :) I'm happy either way. My money spent well.",1

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5"" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the ""norm"" 5""+ form factor.",6

I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5"" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5"" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5"" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"We bought two of these phones (at full price, so this is an actual customer review, not one that may be biased by having received it for free or at a discount) a few months ago and still really love them. We spent quite a bit of time researching all of the options available both above and below this price range, and this phone looked to be a great value, and it really is. We are very pleased with our purchase. We use it with T-Mobile on one of their pre-paid plans and have had a very good experience with the phone and T-Mobile. We are also going to be traveling outside the country, and this phone comes unlocked and supports all of the bands that we need.Pros: The screen looks great, and is very bright and crisp. The camera takes very nice pictures and video. The phone fits nicely in the hand and looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. The build quality is excellent. We charge them after a couple days of normal use, so the battery seems to last a respectable amount of time. The sound, as other reviewers have mentioned, is just excellent. This thing can really put out some sound, and gone are the days of not being able to hear your phone ring! Playing music on it sounds great, and is stereo (one speaker at each end of the phone). The phone is reversible, with a microphone and speaker at each end, so it doesn't matter which way its facing when you pick it up to answer it, the phone will just take care of it based on the orientation using the gyro sensor. This isn't really a must have feature, but it is kind of nice. It plays videos (such as YouTube) very well, and it feels very smooth and responsive in every app we've tried. The value for the money is great, and we would still be very happy with it if we paid more.Cons:Wish it supported dual sim cards instead of just one, but you get a microSD card spot instead, so not too bad and most people probably only need one sim card slot anyway.Wish the volume could be adjusted in smaller increments, but this isn't the phone's fault, it's an android thing and not a deal breaker at all.In closing, we are very pleased with our purchase of two of these phones and would quickly and happily buy them again. If you are looking for a great unlocked GSM phone and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, then give this one a try. We highly recommend it!",3

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,292.98,5,"This seems to be a great little phone.When I saw it would cost $700 to get a new Samsung to replace my old S3, I shopped around. I bought the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7"") from Amazon and after a week am pretty much thrilled at how well it works.The setup had some bumps for me because my cloud files were not up to date. My advice here is to update your contacts, files (including downloads), and pictures before cluttering the new phone with junk So don't log in to your Google acount (yes, even just for email) until stuff is updated and synch'ed up on the old phone.Also, perhaps because the Alcatel phone is ""unlocked"" and is not a service provider's proprietary device, it does not wake up in your hand knowing how to handle internet data. When you enter an in-range WiFi password, the Internet will work fine. To get it to work when you do NOT have WiFi, you will need to setup the mobile networks. This might be as easy as selecting your; provider in settings:(wireless networks - more - mobile networks - access point names - and then either select yourprovider.) You might need to enter the info manually if your provider is not listed. I found listings online by searching for ""AT&T Alcatel APN settings"" but didn't need it because my carrier is AT&T and there was a preconfigured choice as I described earlier.The ""unlocked"" feature is great because it means the phone works with SIM chips from any provider. So if I switch from AT&T to Verizon, Sprint, or any other service provider, this phone will work instantly as soon as I insert the chip. Also, if I travel to a foreign country -- in addition to being able to function on multiple networks --, I will be able to buy a chip for any country and put it into my own phone. If you have travelled, you know what I am talking about. Using your own phone is wonderful in foreign countries.NOTE: My phone accepted a memory chip in addition to the SIM; I see you CAN get a dual SIM option; which I do not understand. The little chip carrier can removed by pushing a paper clip into the tiny hole on the left side of the phone. The little tray slides all the way out. The chips do not fit snugly, but must be sort of balanced or set carefully and then inserted gently. I was actually surprised when it worked because the whole process seemed to require more faith than skill. The phone is so small and compact, it is easy to forgive this space saving compromise.I haven't compared the camera, but it seems fine. I got accustomed to popping the back off my Samsung and just dropping in a newly charged battery, but the Alcatel is sealed. I guess if the battery dies I will need to send it in for service or just replace the whole thing.In general, I think there are enough good reasons to give this phone a try and it is a low risk. Alcatel also makes a 5.5"" phone, so if you want a bigger unit, it's an option.I know this sounds almost evangelical, but I do pay attention to details. Seems like a winner to me.",

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,3,"Decent phone for the money, but if you are used to flagships, prepare to embrace the lag. The UI lags severely even with hardly any apps running.Pros: - Screen. Very bright and colorful 1080p display. - Speakers. JBL audio working great. Plenty loud - MicroSD. Great to have. Allows apps natively installed to the card. Great feature with only 16 GB on board. - LTE. Grabbed LTE on ATT no problem.Cons - LAG. SOOO BAD! sent it back within a few hours of getting it. The Zenfone 2 blows it away in this category. - No fast charging. This might be able to be overlooked, but after having a Nexus 6 and the Zenfone, you get spoiled by it.Overall if you can deal with the lag and sluggishness, it's a great phone. I don't game on my phone as I have a tablet, which is why I tried this phone thinking it can do daily tasks fine but the UI lagging just got to me. I think the culprit is it only being clocked at 1.5 ghz, even the lower end zenfone @ $199 is 1.8 ghz. for $50 more, go with the Zenfone 2 with 4gb of ram and 64gb on board. Yea, the speaker sucks on the Zen, but the display is still pretty good and it runs so much better.",4
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,1,"So far, I pretty much dislike this phone (""hate"" is too strong a word).All-in-all, I'm fairly unimpressed, and I don't understand the ""hype"" about this phone; last month when it was introduced, I even saw it featured on a local TV News segment. I suppose it's major draw is it's relative affordability compared to the Big Brand Name smartphones?CONS:I've been looking for WEEKS to find a complete User Manual because the manufacturer DOESN'T HAVE ONE. It seems that there are a lot of things/features/functions not covered in the Quick Start Guide.The battery life is unimpressive; my 3-and-a-half year old Samsung Note (the original, first generation Note) has the same battery life as this.Why the heck is the Ringtone/notification so FREAKING LOUD even at the lowest setting?!Why can you NEVER turn-off the vibrate/buzz regardless of turning it off in all the settings that give you the option of turning it off? You can either have the lowest (but pretty darn loud) volume set for ringing and notifications, or vibrate/buzz. There is no ""silent"". Silent = buzz.Even with the option of the LED Notification light, which is meant to preclude the use of buzz.PROS:Yes, the display/screen quality and resolution are very nice.The overall quality of the manufacturing is excellent and exactly like any of the Big Name Brand expensive phones (you cannot tell that it is a ""low-priced"" phone at all, it looks and feels great).I prefer big phones/phablets and find this phone is a nice size.I cannot comment on the JBL/Harmon sound; I have heard only ringtones and notification tones and buzzing, which seem the same quality as any modern, good-to-best-quality name brand smartphone.In fairness, some of the things I don't like I suspect are just my own fault for not learning Android 5/Lollipop completely yet - and maybe a lot of stuff I just really hate about Lollipop...But I'm comparing this to another family member's new phone that runs Lollipop and this Alcatel phone has some very weird and undesirable features/functions, and is missing some of the more desirable ones (for my uses).It could also very well be that this is simply not the right kind of Smartphone for me.I use my phones for Internet if needed when I'm not near a PC, messaging, the occasional actual phone call, and photos;never as a music player or for watching TV/movies/videos or as an eReader (that's what my massive LED HD TVs and tablets are for).",2

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,4,"My first impressions for this phone is pretty good. I'm happy to see the amount of flagship phone qualities that this packs for under $300. I previously had the Samsung Galaxy S4 and I’m happy with the switch so far. I’m loving the 5.5 inch screen for browsing the web or watching videos although it’s going to take some time for me to adjust to the size of the phone. The dual facing front speakers are great, it’s much louder and clearer than the S4’s speaker. The near stock Android user interface was nice and smooth with some lag when opening up new applications. However, there are some problems that keeps this phone away from getting a 5 star rating. The power button is placed too high to operate without adjusting your hands and I thought that the double tap to power feature would help alleviate this problem but it doesn’t work most of the time when the screen is off. One more problem is the video recording quality looks low quality, during playback it’s like watching 360p or 480p videos that is scaled up to 1080p. These problems can probably be fixed with new updates, but until then I’ll leave the rating at a 4 star for now. Here are some other pros and cons.Pros:- Bright and clear display- Great dual front facing speakers- Pretty smooth user interface- Good reception (I had no issues connecting this phone with the AT&T network)- Camera takes decent pictures for the price- Slim body- Reversible screen and call featureCons:- Power button placement- Double tap power feature is unreliable at times (subject to change)- Poor quality 1080p video recording (subject to change)- Some lag when opening application- Lack of IR blaster- Non user replaceable battery- Radio feature gets terrible receptionOther note:- The phone call sound effect volume gradually gets lower when you call someone. I don’t know if this is intentional or a defective speaker. However, when the person answers their phone the volume seemed fine throughout the call.",3

I bought 3 units of the idol 3 for me and my 2 brothers, I bought 2 of them in July 2015 and bought the third in Jan 2016.I bought them all from Amazon and had them shipped to me where I live in the Middle East.The phone was a bit laggy and had its problems, but hey you can't complain for $250! However, the lack of support was truly shameful, we were stuck in Android 5.0.2 for a really long time!Anyway that is not my problem here, my problem is that I think the idol 3 has huge manufacturing problem!Few weeks ago, my screen cracked right under the headphone jack, what made things worst is that I couldn't use the phone once the screen was cracked, because I thinks the digitizer is fused with the screen in this phone to make it thinner. I thought I somehow was the reason that the screen cracked, but guess what?! Yesterday my brother phone cracked too, In the right same spot where my phone cracked, right under the headphone jack! This can't be a coincidence! It's the exact same place, you can take a look at the images I attached to this review!so, I'm advising you to stay away from the Idol 3 and any other cheap products from Alcatel, including the Idol 4.",14

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,3,"I bought this phone about a year ago and was initially very happy. Since the most recent update, however, it is slow and at times will not read my SIM card. As in, I'll be in the middle of a conversation and the call drops, I look at my screen, and it says ""No SIM card installed."" The touch screen has also gotten buggy; sometimes, you have to beat it half to death to get it to engage, other times, it calls people when something inside my purse first turns it on and then brushes against the screen. Bizarre.Having said all of this, I am on TMobile, so some of these issues may be related to the recent removal of band 12 compatibility. I definitely notice a huge drop in the call quality since the most recent update, to the point that I want to throttle the thing out the window. Even with a headset (I have tried 4 different ones), people on the other end complain that they can't hear me.As to the screen being fragile, that has not been my experience. I have dropped the phone many, many times (often onto a concrete floor) and it hasn't broken, and I haven't noticed any scratching on the screen. I don't have any kind of case on it and it swims around in my purse unprotected, so there's that.I think this is probably a really good phone for the money -- if you're not on TMobile. I really enjoyed it initially and felt a little smug that I had gotten such a great phone for such a low price. I am buying something else, though, because I've lost patience with the call quality and other strange bugginess since the update.",0
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,4,"Seemed like a great buy at the time. Having owned it for a while now I see 4 major shortcomings:1. Useless as an alarm clock. Completely unreliable. Sometimes goes off at the right time. Many times does not. Takes away half the functionality.2. OS will not grant many apps write permissions to the SD card. The app will ask for it, send you to a system screen, and the system screen won't show the SD card. I call support and they say it's the app's fault (these are apps downloaded tens of millions times like rocket player and ES file browser). They say, with a straight face, that I should only use the stock apps they provide. I was stunned.3. As pretty as the big screen is, it is NOT healthy for my eyes. I was hoping to read more on it. I have stopped doing that. No sub for a good screen (eg of a decent size tablet) for comfortable reading.4. Likely will be stuck on Lollipop 5.0.2 forever. Not even 5.1.1. Very disappointing.Would not recommend.Late edit: After upgrading to Android Marshmallow problems 1,2 and 4 went away.

My old Samsung S4 died after many years of faithful service so I looked into getting the latest and greatest Samsung. The price of a new S7 immediately had me searching for ""best cheap android phones"". I came across this Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 and bought it. NO REGRETS! The size is perfect for what I was looking for. I was able to sync the applications that I wanted back to this new phone. Performance is acceptable and the price is exceptional. The camera is not the best, however for what I need, it is more than what is required. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to get a nicely appointed phone and not feel like you are getting robbed.",1
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,5,"UPDATE:I installed the new Marshmallow update yesterday and OH MY GOD is it smooth. It's has so much less lag it's like I have a new phone!Unfortunately updating to Marshmallow removed the ability to use T-Mobile Band 12 LTE (you still get LTE on other bands) which you can't change unless you Root your phone and flash the previous radio software. But I think it's 100% worth the trade off. Get this phone now! If mine breaks I think I'll get another, no joke.----------------------First off this is the most beautiful phone I've ever owned and the speakers and screen are to die for.But the processor/RAM/internal memory/software leave a lot to be desired. It's soooo slow at times, and I usually can't have more than a few apps open at once if I want it to work at all. I'm only keeping it because I love the speakers and I'm gonna be getting the IDOL 4S when it comes out because it has specs I have been wanting for 2 years.Everything I mentioned as a downside are improved in the 4S, double the internal memory, 3GB RAM, SD 652 processor which is better than the SD 808!!! And newer software of course.I just hope I can sell the idol 3 for $100 to put towards the new one. I still think this isn't a bad phone for under $200, especially if you love good front facing speakers. but I hate how slow it is.",1

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,1,"False Advertising! T-Mobile Users Beware! I purchased two of these phones (The first in June 2015 from Amazon and the second one in Sep 2015 directly from Alcatel who used Amazon to fulfill the order). My Primary reason for the purchases was support for T-Mobile Band 12 and the price point. Well, for the last couple of months, the signal quality has been noticeably worse,...missing calls, texts etc. I tried to think back to what changed and I remembered an OTA update in Janurary from Alcatel. After some research, I discovered that Alcatel's Janurary OTA firmware update REMOVED support for T-Mobile band 12! They actually took away the feature that was my primary reason for purchase. No warnings, no communications. It was done secretly and now I have two phones that perform very poorly. When I contacted them their response was basically ""Screw you...too bad."" I have read they have no plans to update it and make it work. It's bringing your new car to the dealer for an oil change and them removing your transmission without telling you leaving you with a useless hunk of metal. Shame on you Alcatel/TCL and Amazon!

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,4,"Switched from a OnePlus One. Is it worth the switch? depends. This is a good mid-range phone. Main reason why I switched phones is because this phone supports band 2, 4, and 12 on T-Mobile's LTE network. Where as the OnePlus One only supports band 4. Although the OnePlus One's performance is better, it does have bug issues with both Cyanogen 12 (CM12), and their Oxygen OS versions of Android 5 Lollipop. Plus, people on the other end were complaining they can't hear me clearly.Pros:- Good screen quality (Bright)- Good sound quality (with JBL dual front facing speakers)- Plastic build does not feel cheap. Has nice ""brushed"" effect- Band 2, 4, and 12 support on T-Mobile's LTE Network- Battery lasts whole day- Expandable storage with MicroSD card up to 128GB- 13MP back, 8MP front camera- Reversible- Decent quality earbuds included- Good call quality, other person can hear me clearly- $249 priceCons:- Screen quality is on the bright side. It doesn't get dark enough when turned all the way down. (had to use a screen filter app to make the screen dimmer than the lowest setting)- Camera sound/mic quality is not good.- Performance issues (can lag and freeze with certain apps. Its a software issue. Alcatel has sent out an update which helped it a little, but it still has not been completely resolved. Hoping Alcatel will send out another update soon. SnapChat has noticeable performance issues. The SnapDragon 615 has enough power to handle the performance, since lower ranged phones can handle SnapChat with no issues.)- Alcatel's light skin over Android Lollipop is ok, but it would be better if they left it stock Android.",2

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,5,"I love this phone so much. As a former alcatel oneouch S pop owner, I was kind of unsure if this was the phone for me (as it had stopped working). But after watching and reading countless reviews, I said why not? and can i say best decision of my life! I had a budget of $250 so it was right on the budget but has awesome quality. I was so surprised! Not only does it have the newest form of android (lollipop) but really cool features like the reversible feature. It also has great icons and the screen quality is great. There is a JBU mix feature that has this dj mixing feature which was cool. On all the reviews I watched everyone complained about lag, I played about 15 levels of cooking fever and it didn't stutter once. The phone is also really light weight even though is waay bigger than my onetouch S pop it is still much lighter. It also has a good camera, both front and back. Awesome phone and awesome price.",2
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,5,"I’m not going to get into too many explicit specs on the phone because I am trying to review this from a real-world, does-it-work? perspective. I don’t care about benchmarks, I care about how I was able to use this phone in my everyday life. If you want every technical detail, you can go here.Hardware/ScreenThe Idol is a 5.5 inch phone with a 1080p IPS screen. The back of the phone has a plastic back, but not removable (so no battery swapping). There are some faux-chrome accents that go around the device and the speakers (dual-front facing, more on that later) are at the very tippy-top and bottom of the phone. The phone feels pretty nice in the hand and wasn’t hard to hold.The screen is fantastic and one of the best features of the phone. Alcatel uses some buzz-words to describe it (TECHNICOLOR!) but the simplest way to put it is that the screen is vivid, bright and crystal clear. It’s not flagship level for 2015, that would require a QHD screen, but what it lacks in resolution vs. something like the LG G4 or Samsung Galaxy S6, it makes up for by being $300+ cheaper (off contract) than any other flagship device. Simply put, the Idol’s screen is so nice, it doesn’t feel like it should be on a phone so cheap.My other favorite hardware feature is the inclusion of a MircoSD slot next to the sim card slot (which are both in a tray that’s ejected from the left side of the phone). I basically can’t buy a phone without extra storage because I prefer to keep as much music downloaded to my phone as I can, to avoid streaming (either due to data restrictions or having access to it when I am in areas with poor coverage). The storage is up-gradable to 128gb, which goes on top of the 16gb the phone offers out of the gate (almost 10gb usable out of the box).Sound QualityThe quality of sound I get from a smartphone is critical to me. I’d say I place listening to music/podcasts as the number one use I have for a smartphone. My HTC One has audio tuned by Beats, which then morphed into Boomsound, but whatever you want to call it, it sounds great coming from the device or listening via headphones.I’m happy to say that the sound quality is another feature here that seems like it would come from a more expensive phone. Here, Alcatel touts sound tuned by JBL with an option to turn that sound optimization on or off under the settings. I much prefer the sound with the feature on and I’d say it easily rivaled my HTC One for sound quality both when listening from the device or with headphones.There’s a speaker on the top and bottom of the phone, which is, in part, necessary for their upside-down feature. Basically, you can pick up the phone for a call and it will be properly orientated regardless of it being right side up or not. I don’t find the feature to be something that was of great use to me, but I can see the function.Regardless of that feature, having two speakers on the phone is part of what makes it sound great. Some newer phones, like the Asus Zenfone 2 have what looks like dual front speakers, but in reality only one speaker is at the top or the bottom. The Idol gets LOUD when listening from the device. Louder than my One. I love this feature because it makes for listening to music or podcasts in the shower nice and easy to hear. The speakers don’t even seem to become over-burdened when at full volume.Sound quality is on par with the screen, giving the Idol 2 features that feel to be of much better quality that you’d expect from a phone in this price range.UsabilityAndroid Lollipop comes standard (I think I had 5.0 out of the gate) and is near stock. Most of the non-stock features are removable. I’ve grown to love stock Android vs. any skinned version of it, so that was a determining factor for me with the Idol.The general, day-to-day use of the Idol is perfectly adequate, but not overwhelmingly speedy. This was the first part of the phone that felt like “you get what you pay for”. That’s not to say it’s not functional, because it very much so is. Where as I found the lack of speed to be a factor in selling my Moto G, I had no such thoughts with the Idol.There are no issues with multi-tasking, I was easily able to switch between music, maps, a browser and a game. Things like that are just a bit pokey to respond. Not pokey in the sense that it takes 30 seconds of your life from you, but sometimes a program might take 1 or 2 seconds longer to open than you’d see on a phone with a top-of-the-line processor/RAM setup. Those 1 to 2 seconds seem annoying sometimes, but that just speaks to me and my lack of patience. The reality is that this phone works perfectly well and should for the vast majority of users.Call quality is perfectly adequate, but I am probably not someone who should even speak to that. I spend, maybe, 10 minutes a week using my smartphone as an actual phone, but those 10 minutes work very well. I come across clearly as does the person on the other end. The speakerphone has the benefit of the dual speakers, just as a song or podcast does.I feel like the hardware buttons would have been nicer if placed a littler lower. Due to the phone’s size, I had issues with pressing the unlock button with one hand. Not massive issues, since I’ve almost always used two hands with my phone, but for people who like a one hand device, this might not be it (if I’m being honest, I think this is a stupid reason to or not to buy a phone, I tend to just adapt to whatever device I select, but to each their own). The USB port and headphone jack are where you’d expect them, on the bottom and top, respectively.Battery LifeAnother nice feature with the phone is battery life. I don’t consider myself a super heavy user of screen time on a basic day, so I’d easily get home with 50+% after work and make it to bed with 30+% or more. Having the phone on a recent vacation where I was heavy on camera use and GPS I found myself slightly more nervous with battery life, but the phone charges very quickly (60% in 40 minutes, I think) so driving 10 minutes from one place to another, I could give a quick boost and take that nervousness away. Overall, very solid battery life for my (and I think most people’s) usage.CameraHere we get a 13MP rear-facing camera with a 8MP front-facing camera for selfies. All in all, I was very happy with the camera performance. In well lit situations, shots where clear and crisp. Some low-light situations mad for poorer quality pictures, but that’s every camera phone, ever. The biggest struggle for the camera was actually on a cloudy day. I used the camera’s time-lapse video function to film a boat trip I took on Lake Superior and you can see that the phone struggles with it’s focus and makes the land look rather dark against the cloudy sky. This could be user error, however, I’m not sure.Like every other smartphone out there, there’s an HDR function in the menu to give a little more definition to your shots. I think it worked as well as one would expect, but I stuck with the camera’s auto mode for the most part. Check out this gallery here, here and here to see some shots in all sorts of lighting conditions.Other than having the sun blare straight into the camera lens or overly dark shots, I really liked what the camera gave me. Anything I see as a negative with the camera is just the reality of using a smartphone for your main camera due to convenience. They are never going to perform like the best point-and-shoot units, but to have decent performance is nice and the Idol is a step or two above decent.Final VerdictI don’t think you can get this much phone for the money you pay, anywhere else. The Idol is, very easily, worth the extra $70 you’d be spending over a Moto G. The other phone that was hot in the running for me was the Asus Zenfone 2 (4GB Ram Version) but I picked the Idol for its superior sound quality and screen, both of which I think are better than the Asus. I know that OnePlus has their 1’s at a lower cost right now, but the lack of a Mirco SD card took them out of the running for me, I keep a lot of music on my phone.Overall, there is a trade-off between these less expensive, off-contract phones. OnePlus and Asus focused on making a very responsive, powerful phone and Alcatel focused on a better media experience. I don’t think you can go wrong with any of those three options, but the Idol Onetouch 3 was easily the phone for me….…and I miss it. As I alluded to earlier, I am back to my HTC One. I got a little to into my desire to become Ansel Adams that I may or may not have dropped the Idol in a river in Northern Wisconsin. I’d love to get another Idol, but it’s not currently in the budget and I DO have a phone that works, even if I can’t update it. I plan to wait out until next year to see what the Onetouch 4 will bring. Alcatel made a statement with this device and I hope to see them continue making phones at a budget price with specs and usability that outweigh the budget price point.",17

The FM radio is a nice inclusion, wish more phones had this. JBL headphones are nice sound good, and was clearly heard during a phone call. Double tap to wake screen work very well, wish my Nexus 6 had this. It has a very premium feel and screen looks brighter and more vivid than my Nexus 6.

I gave up on my search because I didn't get what I needed in a moderately priced android phone till I saw a friend with the 4.7 inch version of the idol 3. I browsed through and was like 'whaaat, Alcatel did this'? The phone fast, has a good camera, has good speakers and good battery life, because after about 30 minutes of watching videos, the battery didn't drain as it would've on my iPhone 6. I bought one of the 4.7 for my personal use due to its cute size and 4 of the 5.5 to sell. In my country, bigger screen phones sells faster, plus the 5.5 is the better of the two in terms of performance. It's been about a year now and none of the buyers has called to complain about anything. A special someone needs an android OS phone and the only phone that came to mind was the idol 3, my reason for buying again. We had an issue before I received the phone.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129,1,"I bought this phone for my daughter last June 14th and 90 days later, September 16th the phone is dead, no scratches or ding on the phone, nothing. It looks new because from day one it had hard case and film protector. Amazon warranty is over so my daughter called Alcatel almost 10 times to obtain the RMA, to send the phone to get checked and repaired. I like to know why a new phone dies after only 90 days? Nice apologize by Alcatel, but they have yet to send the promised email containing the return label, only providing excuses stating that they ""understand our frustration"". We need solution not excuses. It should be replaced by Alcatel, as it is truly a defective product, not just repaired.Summary: Phone died after only 90 days, Alcatel customer service has been sub-par, promising to provide a shipping label to get the phone repaired but never actually sending it. Don't waste your money with this phone.",24

I am a heavy phone user, this phone this its job. AT&T is my phone carrier I had the option for an upgrade through them but they have this new program where you rent phones for a monthly fee and if you bought a phone outright FROM THEM it would bring in another fee. Basically they want you to rent the phones now. I went to play C and bought this phone so i could save money in the long run.",1
